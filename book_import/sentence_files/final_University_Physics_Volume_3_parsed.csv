94efefac-6c2f-4754-a330-3292820e2b71@6,10.0,3.0,Nuclear Binding Energy,40,"In other words, it takes several million electron volts to pry a nucleon from a typical nucleus, as compared to just 13.6 eV to ionize an electron in the ground state of hydrogen."
94efefac-6c2f-4754-a330-3292820e2b71@6,10.0,3.0,Nuclear Binding Energy,41,"This is why nuclear force is referred to as the ""strong"" nuclear force."

94efefac-6c2f-4754-a330-3292820e2b71@6,10.0,3.0,Nuclear Binding Energy,43,The peak value suggests that the iron nucleus is the most stable nucleus in nature (it is also why nuclear fusion in the cores of stars ends with Fe).
94efefac-6c2f-4754-a330-3292820e2b71@6,10.0,3.0,Nuclear Binding Energy,44,The reason the graph rises and tapers off has to do with competing forces in the nucleus.

94efefac-6c2f-4754-a330-3292820e2b71@6,10.0,3.0,Nuclear Binding Energy,46,"But at high values of  A , repulsive electrostatic forces between forces begin to dominate, and these forces tend to break apart the nucleus rather than hold it together."
