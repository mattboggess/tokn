09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,32,This suggested there were two types of an electric property; this property eventually came to be called  electric charge .
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,33,The difference between the two types of electric charge is in the directions of the electric forces that each type of charge causes: These forces are repulsive when the same type of charge exists on two interacting objects and attractive when the charges are of opposite types.

09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,40,This created a large electric force between the two foil sheets.

09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,49,Let's list the specific observations that we have of this  electric force :     The force acts without physical contact between the two objects.
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,50,"The force can be either attractive or repulsive: If two interacting objects carry the same sign of charge, the force is repulsive; if the charges are of opposite sign, the force is attractive."
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,51,"These interactions are referred to as  electrostatic repulsion  and  electrostatic attraction , respectively."
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,52,Not all objects are affected by this force.
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,53,The magnitude of the force decreases (rapidly) with increasing separation distance between the objects.
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,54,"To be more precise, we find experimentally that the magnitude of the force decreases as the square of the distance between the two interacting objects increases."
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,55,"Thus, for example, when the distance between two interacting objects is doubled, the force between them decreases to one fourth what it was in the original system."
09467e98-8b04-4af0-99aa-67439b42fe54@9,5.0,2.0,Electric Charge,56,We can also observe that the surroundings of the charged objects affect the magnitude of the force.
