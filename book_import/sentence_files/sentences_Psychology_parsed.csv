f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,2,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Understand the etymology of the word ""psychology""   Define psychology   Understand the merits of an education in psychology       In Greek mythology, Psyche was a mortal woman whose beauty was so great that it rivaled that of the goddess Aphrodite."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,3,"Aphrodite became so jealous of Psyche that she sent her son, Eros, to make Psyche fall in love with the ugliest man in the world."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,4,"However, Eros accidentally pricked himself with the tip of his arrow and fell madly in love with Psyche himself."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,5,"He took Psyche to his palace and showered her with gifts, yet she could never see his face."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,6,"While visiting Psyche, her sisters roused suspicion in Psyche about her mysterious lover, and eventually, Psyche betrayed Eros' wishes to remain unseen to her ( Figure 1.2 )."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,7,"Because of this betrayal, Eros abandoned Psyche."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,8,"When Psyche appealed to Aphrodite to reunite her with Eros, Aphrodite gave her a series of impossible tasks to complete."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,9,"Psyche managed to complete all of these trials; ultimately, her perseverance paid off as she was reunited with Eros and was ultimately transformed into a goddess herself (Ashliman, 2001; Greek Myths &amp; Greek Mythology, 2014)."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,10,Figure   1.2        Antonio Canova's sculpture depicts Eros and Psyche.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,11,"Psyche comes to represent the human soul's triumph over the misfortunes of life in the pursuit of true happiness (Bulfinch, 1855); in fact, the Greek word  psyche  means soul, and it is often represented as a butterfly."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,12,"The word  psychology  was coined at a time when the concepts of soul and mind were not as clearly distinguished (Green, 2001)."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,13,"The root  ology  denotes scientific study of, and  psychology  refers to the scientific study of the mind."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,14,"Since science studies only observable phenomena and the mind is not directly observable, we expand this definition to the scientific study of mind and behavior."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,15,The scientific study of any aspect of the world uses the scientific method to acquire knowledge.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,16,"To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,17,A hypothesis is not just any explanation; it should fit into the context of a scientific theory.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,18,A scientific theory is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,19,A theory is the best understanding that we have of that part of the natural world.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,20,"Armed with the hypothesis, the researcher then makes observations or, better still, carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,21,That test and its results are then published so that others can check the results or build on them.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,22,"It is necessary that any explanation in science be testable, which means that the phenomenon must be perceivable and measurable."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,23,"For example, that a bird sings because it is happy is not a testable hypothesis, since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,24,"We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,25,"In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,26,"This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,27,The scientific method is also a form of empiricism.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,28,"An  empirical method  for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,29,It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline.

f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,31,"Given that any behavior is, at its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,32,"No biological organism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others."

f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,35,"Sometimes, students take a psychology course because it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as nursing or pre-med."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,36,Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare psychology as their major.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,37,"As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses across the United States (Johnson &amp; Lubin, 2011)."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,38,A number of well-known individuals were psychology majors.

f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,43,Critical thinking is the active application of a set of skills to information for the understanding and evaluation of that information.
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,44,"The evaluation of information—assessing its reliability and usefulness— is an important skill in a world full of competing ""facts,"" many of which are designed to be misleading."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,45,"For example, critical thinking involves maintaining an attitude of skepticism, recognizing internal biases, making use of logical thinking, asking appropriate questions, and making observations."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,46,"Psychology students also can develop better communication skills during the course of their undergraduate coursework (American Psychological Association, 2011)."
f899805c-f3a3-4c8b-913b-8b4408f3054e@10,1,2,,47,"Together, these factors increase students' scientific literacy and prepare students to critically evaluate the various sources of information they encounter."

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,4,Their names were Wilhelm Wundt and William James.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,5,This section will provide an overview of the shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,6,Wundt and Structuralism   Wilhelm  Wundt  (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,7,His famous book entitled  Principles of Physiological Psychology  was published in 1873.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,8,"Wundt viewed psychology as a scientific study of conscious experience, and he believed that the goal of psychology was to identify components of consciousness and how those components combined to result in our conscious experience."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,9,"Wundt used  introspection  (he called it ""internal perception""), a process by which someone examines their own conscious experience as objectively as possible, making the human mind like any other aspect of nature that a scientist observed."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,10,"Wundt's version of introspection used only very specific experimental conditions in which an external stimulus was designed to produce a scientifically observable (repeatable) experience of the mind (Danziger, 1980)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,11,"The first stringent requirement was the use of ""trained"" or practiced observers, who could immediately observe and report a reaction."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,12,The second requirement was the use of repeatable stimuli that always produced the same experience in the subject and allowed the subject to expect and thus be fully attentive to the inner reaction.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,13,"These experimental requirements were put in place to eliminate ""interpretation"" in the reporting of internal experiences and to counter the argument that there is no way to know that an individual is observing their mind or consciousness accurately, since it cannot be seen by any other person."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,14,This attempt to understand the structure or characteristics of the mind was known as  structuralism .
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,15,Wundt established his psychology laboratory at the University at Leipzig in 1879 ( Figure 1.3 ).
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,16,"In this laboratory, Wundt and his students conducted experiments on, for example, reaction times."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,17,"A subject, sometimes in a room isolated from the scientist, would receive a stimulus such as a light, image, or sound."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,18,"The subject's reaction to the stimulus would be to push a button, and an apparatus would record the time to reaction."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,19,"Wundt could measure reaction time to one-thousandth of a second (Nicolas &amp; Ferrand, 1999)."

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,23,"However, despite his efforts to train individuals in the process of introspection, this process remained highly subjective, and there was very little agreement between individuals."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,24,"As a result, structuralism fell out of favor with the passing of Wundt's student, Edward Titchener, in 1927 (Gordon, 1995)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,25,James and Functionalism   William  James  (1842–1910) was the first American psychologist who espoused a different perspective on how psychology should operate ( Figure 1.4 ).
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,26,James was introduced to Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection and accepted it as an explanation of an organism's characteristics.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,27,"Key to that theory is the idea that natural selection leads to organisms that are adapted to their environment, including their behavior."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,28,"Adaptation means that a trait of an organism has a function for the survival and reproduction of the individual, because it has been naturally selected."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,29,"As James saw it, psychology's purpose was to study the function of behavior in the world, and as such, his perspective was known as  functionalism ."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,30,Functionalism focused on how mental activities helped an organism fit into its environment.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,31,"Functionalism has a second, more subtle meaning in that functionalists were more interested in the operation of the whole mind rather than of its individual parts, which were the focus of structuralism."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,32,"Like Wundt, James believed that introspection could serve as one means by which someone might study mental activities, but James also relied on more objective measures, including the use of various recording devices, and examinations of concrete products of mental activities and of anatomy and physiology (Gordon, 1995)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,33,"Figure   1.4        William James, shown here in a self-portrait, was the first American psychologist."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,34,Freud and Psychoanalytic Theory   Perhaps one of the most influential and well-known figures in psychology's history was Sigmund  Freud  ( Figure 1.5 ).
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,35,"Freud (1856–1939) was an Austrian neurologist who was fascinated by patients suffering from ""hysteria"" and neurosis."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,36,"Hysteria was an ancient diagnosis for disorders, primarily of women with a wide variety of symptoms, including physical symptoms and emotional disturbances, none of which had an apparent physical cause."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,37,Freud theorized that many of his patients' problems arose from the unconscious mind.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,38,"In Freud's view, the unconscious mind was a repository of feelings and urges of which we have no awareness."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,39,"Gaining access to the unconscious, then, was crucial to the successful resolution of the patient's problems."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,40,"According to Freud, the unconscious mind could be accessed through dream analysis, by examinations of the first words that came to people's minds, and through seemingly innocent slips of the tongue."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,41,"Psychoanalytic theory  focuses on the role of a person's unconscious, as well as early childhood experiences, and this particular perspective dominated clinical psychology for several decades (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,42,Figure   1.5        (a) Sigmund Freud was a highly influential figure in the history of psychology.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,43,"b) One of his many books,  A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis , shared his ideas about psychoanalytical therapy; it was published in 1922."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,44,"Freud's ideas were influential, and you will learn more about them when you study lifespan development, personality, and therapy."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,45,"For instance, many therapists believe strongly in the unconscious and the impact of early childhood experiences on the rest of a person's life."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,46,"The method of psychoanalysis, which involves the patient talking about their experiences and selves, while not invented by Freud, was certainly popularized by him and is still used today."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,47,"Many of Freud's other ideas, however, are controversial."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,48,"Drew Westen (1998) argues that many of the criticisms of Freud's ideas are misplaced, in that they attack his older ideas without taking into account later writings."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,49,"Westen also argues that critics fail to consider the success of the broad ideas that Freud introduced or developed, such as the importance of childhood experiences in adult motivations, the role of unconscious versus conscious motivations in driving our behavior, the fact that motivations can cause conflicts that affect behavior, the effects of mental representations of ourselves and others in guiding our interactions, and the development of personality over time."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,50,Westen identifies subsequent research support for all of these ideas.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,51,"More modern iterations of Freud's clinical approach have been empirically demonstrated to be effective (Knekt et al., 2008; Shedler, 2010)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,52,"Some current practices in psychotherapy involve examining unconscious aspects of the self and relationships, often through the relationship between the therapist and the client."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,53,Freud's historical significance and contributions to clinical practice merit his inclusion in a discussion of the historical movements within psychology.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,54,"Wertheimer, Koffka, Köhler, and Gestalt Psychology   Max Wertheimer (1880–1943), Kurt Koffka (1886–1941), and Wolfgang Köhler (1887–1967) were three German psychologists who immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century to escape Nazi Germany."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,55,These men are credited with introducing psychologists in the United States to various Gestalt principles.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,56,"The word  Gestalt  roughly translates to ""whole;"" a major emphasis of Gestalt psychology deals with the fact that although a sensory experience can be broken down into individual parts, how those parts relate to each other as a whole is often what the individual responds to in perception."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,57,"For example, a song may be made up of individual notes played by different instruments, but the real nature of the song is perceived in the combinations of these notes as they form the melody, rhythm, and harmony."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,58,"In many ways, this particular perspective would have directly contradicted Wundt's ideas of structuralism (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,59,"Unfortunately, in moving to the United States, these men were forced to abandon much of their work and were unable to continue to conduct research on a large scale."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,60,"These factors along with the rise of behaviorism (described next) in the United States prevented principles of Gestalt psychology from being as influential in the United States as they had been in their native Germany (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,61,"Despite these issues, several Gestalt principles are still very influential today."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,62,Considering the human individual as a whole rather than as a sum of individually measured parts became an important foundation in humanistic theory late in the century.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,63,The ideas of Gestalt have continued to influence research on sensation and perception.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,64,"Structuralism, Freud, and the Gestalt psychologists were all concerned in one way or another with describing and understanding inner experience."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,65,"But other researchers had concerns that inner experience could be a legitimate subject of scientific inquiry and chose instead to exclusively study behavior, the objectively observable outcome of mental processes."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,66,"Pavlov, Watson, Skinner, and Behaviorism   Early work in the field of behavior was conducted by the Russian physiologist Ivan  Pavlov  (1849–1936)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,67,"Pavlov studied a form of learning behavior called a conditioned reflex, in which an animal or human produced a reflex (unconscious) response to a stimulus and, over time, was conditioned to produce the response to a different stimulus that the experimenter associated with the original stimulus."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,68,The reflex Pavlov worked with was salivation in response to the presence of food.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,69,"The salivation reflex could be elicited using a second stimulus, such as a specific sound, that was presented in association with the initial food stimulus several times."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,70,"Once the response to the second stimulus was ""learned,"" the food stimulus could be omitted."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,71,"Pavlov's ""classical conditioning"" is only one form of learning behavior studied by behaviorists."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,72,John B.  Watson  (1878–1958) was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University ( Figure 1.6 ).
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,73,"While Wundt and James were concerned with understanding conscious experience, Watson thought that the study of consciousness was flawed."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,74,"Because he believed that objective analysis of the mind was impossible, Watson preferred to focus directly on observable behavior and try to bring that behavior under control."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,75,"Watson was a major proponent of shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to behavior, and this approach of observing and controlling behavior came to be known as  behaviorism ."

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,77,"Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments under the assumption that what was learned using animal models could, to some degree, be applied to human behavior."

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,86,"Like Watson, Skinner was a behaviorist, and he concentrated on how behavior was affected by its consequences."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,87,"Therefore, Skinner spoke of reinforcement and punishment as major factors in driving behavior."

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,93,"When the animal pushes the button or lever, the box is able to deliver a positive reinforcement of the behavior (such as food) or a punishment (such as a noise) or a token conditioner (such as a light) that is correlated with either the positive reinforcement or punishment."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,94,Skinner's focus on positive and negative reinforcement of learned behaviors had a lasting influence in psychology that has waned somewhat since the growth of research in cognitive psychology.

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,101,"Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment."

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,108,"Maslow asserted that so long as basic needs necessary for survival were met (e.g., food, water, shelter), higher-level needs (e.g., social needs) would begin to motivate behavior."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,109,"According to Maslow, the highest-level needs relate to self-actualization, a process by which we achieve our full potential."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,110,"Obviously, the focus on the positive aspects of human nature that are characteristic of the humanistic perspective is evident (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005)."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,111,"Humanistic psychologists rejected, on principle, the research approach based on reductionist experimentation in the tradition of the physical and biological sciences, because it missed the ""whole"" human being."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,112,"Beginning with Maslow and Rogers, there was an insistence on a humanistic research program."

940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,116,Rogers used a therapeutic technique known as client-centered therapy in helping his clients deal with problematic issues that resulted in their seeking psychotherapy.
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,117,"Unlike a psychoanalytic approach in which the therapist plays an important role in interpreting what conscious behavior reveals about the unconscious mind, client-centered therapy involves the patient taking a lead role in the therapy session."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,118,"Rogers believed that a therapist needed to display three features to maximize the effectiveness of this particular approach: unconditional positive regard, genuineness, and empathy."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,119,"Unconditional positive regard refers to the fact that the therapist accepts their client for who they are, no matter what he or she might say."
940601bd-564c-444d-9952-9d44f82cf324@13,1,3,History of Psychology,120,"Provided these factors, Rogers believed that people were more than capable of dealing with and working through their own issues (Thorne &amp; Henley, 2005)."

b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,4,"The APA is the largest organization of psychologists in the world, and its mission is to advance and disseminate psychological knowledge for the betterment of people."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,5,"There are 56 divisions within the APA, representing a wide variety of specialties that range from Societies for the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality to Exercise and Sport Psychology to Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,6,"Reflecting the diversity of the field of psychology itself, members, affiliate members, and associate members span the spectrum from students to doctoral-level psychologists, and come from a variety of places including educational settings, criminal justice, hospitals, the armed forces, and industry (American Psychological Association, 2014)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,7,The Association for Psychological Science (APS) was founded in 1988 and seeks to advance the scientific orientation of psychology.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,8,Its founding resulted from disagreements between members of the scientific and clinical branches of psychology within the APA.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,9,The APS publishes five research journals and engages in education and advocacy with funding agencies.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,10,"A significant proportion of its members are international, although the majority is located in the United States."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,11,"Other organizations provide networking and collaboration opportunities for professionals of several ethnic or racial groups working in psychology, such as the National Latina/o Psychological Association (NLPA), the Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA), the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), and the Society of Indian Psychologists (SIP)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,12,Most of these groups are also dedicated to studying psychological and social issues within their specific communities.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,13,This section will provide an overview of the major subdivisions within psychology today in the order in which they are introduced throughout the remainder of this textbook.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,14,"This is not meant to be an exhaustive listing, but it will provide insight into the major areas of research and practice of modern-day psychologists."

b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,17,"Biopsychology and Evolutionary Psychology   As the name suggests,  biopsychology  explores how our biology influences our behavior."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,18,"While biological psychology is a broad field, many biological psychologists want to understand how the structure and function of the nervous system is related to behavior ( Figure 1.11 )."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,19,"As such, they often combine the research strategies of both psychologists and physiologists to accomplish this goal (as discussed in Carlson, 2013)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,20,Figure   1.11        Biological psychologists study how the structure and function of the nervous system generate behavior.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,21,"The research interests of biological psychologists span a number of domains, including but not limited to, sensory and motor systems, sleep, drug use and abuse, ingestive behavior, reproductive behavior, neurodevelopment, plasticity of the nervous system, and biological correlates of psychological disorders."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,22,"Given the broad areas of interest falling under the purview of biological psychology, it will probably come as no surprise that individuals from all sorts of backgrounds are involved in this research, including biologists, medical professionals, physiologists, and chemists."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,23,"This interdisciplinary approach is often referred to as neuroscience, of which biological psychology is a component (Carlson, 2013)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,24,"While biopsychology typically focuses on the immediate causes of behavior based in the physiology of a human or other animal, evolutionary psychology seeks to study the ultimate biological causes of behavior."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,25,"To the extent that a behavior is impacted by genetics, a behavior, like any anatomical characteristic of a human or animal, will demonstrate adaption to its surroundings."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,26,"These surroundings include the physical environment and, since interactions between organisms can be important to survival and reproduction, the social environment."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,27,"The study of behavior in the context of evolution has its origins with Charles Darwin, the co-discoverer of the theory of evolution by natural selection."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,28,"Darwin was well aware that behaviors should be adaptive and wrote books titled,  The Descent of Man  (1871) and  The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals  (1872), to explore this field."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,29,"Evolutionary psychology, and specifically, the  evolutionary psychology  of humans, has enjoyed a resurgence in recent decades."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,30,"To be subject to evolution by natural selection, a behavior must have a significant genetic cause."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,31,"In general, we expect all human cultures to express a behavior if it is caused genetically, since the genetic differences among human groups are small."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,32,"The approach taken by most evolutionary psychologists is to predict the outcome of a behavior in a particular situation based on evolutionary theory and then to make observations, or conduct experiments, to determine whether the results match the theory."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,33,"It is important to recognize that these types of studies are not strong evidence that a behavior is adaptive, since they lack information that the behavior is in some part genetic and not entirely cultural (Endler, 1986)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,34,"Demonstrating that a trait, especially in humans, is naturally selected is extraordinarily difficult; perhaps for this reason, some evolutionary psychologists are content to assume the behaviors they study have genetic determinants (Confer et al., 2010)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,35,"One other drawback of evolutionary psychology is that the traits that we possess now evolved under environmental and social conditions far back in human history, and we have a poor understanding of what these conditions were."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,36,This makes predictions about what is adaptive for a behavior difficult.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,37,"Behavioral traits need not be adaptive under current conditions, only under the conditions of the past when they evolved, about which we can only hypothesize."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,38,There are many areas of human behavior for which evolution can make predictions.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,39,"Examples include memory, mate choice, relationships between kin, friendship and cooperation, parenting, social organization, and status (Confer et al., 2010)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,40,Evolutionary psychologists have had success in finding experimental correspondence between observations and expectations.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,41,"In one example, in a study of mate preference differences between men and women that spanned 37 cultures, Buss (1989) found that women valued earning potential factors greater than men, and men valued potential reproductive factors (youth and attractiveness) greater than women in their prospective mates."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,42,"In general, the predictions were in line with the predictions of evolution, although there were deviations in some cultures."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,43,Sensation and Perception   Scientists interested in both physiological aspects of sensory systems as well as in the psychological experience of sensory information work within the area of  sensation  and  perception  ( Figure 1.12 ).
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,44,"As such, sensation and perception research is also quite interdisciplinary."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,45,Imagine walking between buildings as you move from one class to another.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,46,"You are inundated with sights, sounds, touch sensations, and smells."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,47,You also experience the temperature of the air around you and maintain your balance as you make your way.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,48,These are all factors of interest to someone working in the domain of sensation and perception.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,49,"Figure   1.12        When you look at this image, you may see a duck or a rabbit."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,50,"The sensory information remains the same, but your perception can vary dramatically."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,51,"As described in a later chapter that focuses on the results of studies in sensation and perception, our experience of our world is not as simple as the sum total of all of the sensory information (or sensations) together."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,52,"Rather, our experience (or perception) is complex and is influenced by where we focus our attention, our previous experiences, and even our cultural backgrounds."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,53,"Cognitive Psychology   As mentioned in the previous section, the cognitive revolution created an impetus for psychologists to focus their attention on better understanding the mind and mental processes that underlie behavior."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,54,"Thus,  cognitive psychology  is the area of psychology that focuses on studying cognitions, or thoughts, and their relationship to our experiences and our actions."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,55,"Like biological psychology, cognitive psychology is broad in its scope and often involves collaborations among people from a diverse range of disciplinary backgrounds."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,56,"This has led some to coin the term cognitive science to describe the interdisciplinary nature of this area of research (Miller, 2003)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,57,"Cognitive psychologists have research interests that span a spectrum of topics, ranging from attention to problem solving to language to memory."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,58,The approaches used in studying these topics are equally diverse.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,59,"Given such diversity, cognitive psychology is not captured in one chapter of this text per se; rather, various concepts related to cognitive psychology will be covered in relevant portions of the chapters in this text on sensation and perception, thinking and intelligence, memory, lifespan development, social psychology, and therapy."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,60,Link to Learning     View a  brief video  recapping some of the major concepts explored by cognitive psychologists.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,61,Developmental Psychology    Developmental psychology  is the scientific study of development across a lifespan.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,62,Developmental psychologists are interested in processes related to physical maturation.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,63,"However, their focus is not limited to the physical changes associated with aging, as they also focus on changes in cognitive skills, moral reasoning, social behavior, and other psychological attributes."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,64,"Early developmental psychologists focused primarily on changes that occurred through reaching adulthood, providing enormous insight into the differences in physical, cognitive, and social capacities that exist between very young children and adults."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,65,"For instance, research by Jean  Piaget  ( Figure 1.13 ) demonstrated that very young children do not demonstrate object permanence."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,66,"Object permanence refers to the understanding that physical things continue to exist, even if they are hidden from us."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,67,"If you were to show an adult a toy, and then hide it behind a curtain, the adult knows that the toy still exists."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,68,"However, very young infants act as if a hidden object no longer exists."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,69,"The age at which object permanence is achieved is somewhat controversial (Munakata, McClelland, Johnson, and Siegler, 1997)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,70,Figure   1.13        Jean Piaget is famous for his theories regarding changes in cognitive ability that occur as we move from infancy to adulthood.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,71,"While Piaget was focused on cognitive changes during infancy and childhood as we move to adulthood, there is an increasing interest in extending research into the changes that occur much later in life."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,72,This may be reflective of changing population demographics of developed nations as a whole.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,73,"As more and more people live longer lives, the number of people of advanced age will continue to increase."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,74,"Indeed, it is estimated that there were just over 40 million people aged 65 or older living in the United States in 2010."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,75,"However, by 2020, this number is expected to increase to about 55 million."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,76,"By the year 2050, it is estimated that nearly 90 million people in this country will be 65 or older (Department of Health and Human Services, n.d.)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,77,Personality Psychology    Personality psychology  focuses on patterns of thoughts and behaviors that make each individual unique.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,78,"Several individuals (e.g., Freud and Maslow) that we have already discussed in our historical overview of psychology, and the American psychologist Gordon Allport, contributed to early theories of personality."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,79,These early theorists attempted to explain how an individual's personality develops from his or her given perspective.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,80,"For example, Freud proposed that personality arose as conflicts between the conscious and unconscious parts of the mind were carried out over the lifespan."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,81,"Specifically, Freud theorized that an individual went through various psychosexual stages of development."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,82,"According to Freud, adult personality would result from the resolution of various conflicts that centered on the migration of erogenous (or sexual pleasure-producing) zones from the oral (mouth) to the anus to the phallus to the genitals."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,83,"Like many of Freud's theories, this particular idea was controversial and did not lend itself to experimental tests (Person, 1980)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,84,"More recently, the study of personality has taken on a more quantitative approach."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,85,"Rather than explaining how personality arises, research is focused on identifying  personality traits , measuring these traits, and determining how these traits interact in a particular context to determine how a person will behave in any given situation."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,86,"Personality traits are relatively consistent patterns of thought and behavior, and many have proposed that five trait dimensions are sufficient to capture the variations in personality seen across individuals."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,87,"These five dimensions are known as the ""Big Five"" or the  Five Factor model , and include dimensions of conscientiousness, agreeableness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion ( Figure 1.14 )."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,88,"Each of these traits has been demonstrated to be relatively stable over the lifespan (e.g., Rantanen, Metsäpelto, Feldt, Pulkinnen, and Kokko, 2007; Soldz &amp; Vaillant, 1999; McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008) and is influenced by genetics (e.g., Jang, Livesly, and Vernon, 1996)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,89,Figure   1.14        Each of the dimensions of the Five Factor model is shown in this figure.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,90,The provided description would describe someone who scored highly on that given dimension.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,91,Someone with a lower score on a given dimension could be described in opposite terms.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,92,Social Psychology    Social psychology  focuses on how we interact with and relate to others.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,93,"Social psychologists conduct research on a wide variety of topics that include differences in how we explain our own behavior versus how we explain the behaviors of others, prejudice, and attraction, and how we resolve interpersonal conflicts."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,94,Social psychologists have also sought to determine how being among other people changes our own behavior and patterns of thinking.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,95,"There are many interesting examples of social psychological research, and you will read about many of these in a later chapter of this textbook."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,96,"Until then, you will be introduced to one of the most controversial psychological studies ever conducted."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,97,Stanley  Milgram  was an American social psychologist who is most famous for research that he conducted on obedience.
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,98,"After the holocaust, in 1961, a Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, who was accused of committing mass atrocities, was put on trial."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,99,"Many people wondered how German soldiers were capable of torturing prisoners in concentration camps, and they were unsatisfied with the excuses given by soldiers that they were simply following orders."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,100,"At the time, most psychologists agreed that few people would be willing to inflict such extraordinary pain and suffering, simply because they were obeying orders."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,101,Milgram decided to conduct research to determine whether or not this was true ( Figure 1.15 ).
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,102,"As you will read later in the text, Milgram found that nearly two-thirds of his participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be lethal shocks to another person, simply because they were instructed to do so by an authority figure (in this case, a man dressed in a lab coat)."
b441f14d-1a24-4127-b289-2db6ea1ec9da@11,1,4,Contemporary Psychology,103,This was in spite of the fact that participants received payment for simply showing up for the research study and could have chosen not to inflict pain or more serious consequences on another person by withdrawing from the study.

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,4,"While many of us feel confident in our abilities to decipher and interact with the world around us, history is filled with examples of how very wrong we can be when we fail to recognize the need for evidence in supporting claims."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,5,"At various times in history, we would have been certain that the sun revolved around a flat earth, that the earth's continents did not move, and that mental illness was caused by possession ( Figure 2.2 )."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,6,It is through systematic scientific research that we divest ourselves of our preconceived notions and superstitions and gain an objective understanding of ourselves and our world.

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,10,"In contrast to other methods that people use to understand the behavior of others, such as intuition and personal experience, the hallmark of scientific research is that there is evidence to support a claim."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,11,"Scientific knowledge is  empirical : It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again, regardless of who is observing."

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,14,"However, the reason for the behavior is more difficult to determine."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,15,"Is the person crying due to being sad, in pain, or happy?"
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,16,"Sometimes we can learn the reason for someone's behavior by simply asking a question, like ""Why are you crying?"""
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,17,"However, there are situations in which an individual is either uncomfortable or unwilling to answer the question honestly, or is incapable of answering."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,18,"For example, infants would not be able to explain why they are crying."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,19,"In such circumstances, the psychologist must be creative in finding ways to better understand behavior."

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,23,"In these cases, we are witnessing the scientific community going through the process of reaching a consensus, and it could be quite some time before a consensus emerges."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,24,"For example, the hypothesized link between exposure to media violence and subsequent aggression has been debated in the scientific community for roughly 60 years."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,25,"Even today, we will find detractors, but a consensus is building."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,26,"Several professional organizations view media violence exposure as a risk factor for actual violence, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological Association (American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry, American Psychological Association, American Medical Association, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Psychiatric Association, 2000)."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,27,"In the meantime, we should strive to think critically about the information we encounter by exercising a degree of healthy skepticism."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,28,"When someone makes a claim, we should examine the claim from a number of different perspectives: what is the expertise of the person making the claim, what might they gain if the claim is valid, does the claim seem justified given the evidence, and what do other researchers think of the claim?"
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,29,"This is especially important when we consider how much information in advertising campaigns and on the internet claims to be based on ""scientific evidence"" when in actuality it is a belief or perspective of just a few individuals trying to sell a product or draw attention to their perspectives."

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,67,"In this example, the hypothesis is correct; therefore, the conclusion is correct as well."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,68,"Sometimes, however, an incorrect hypothesis may lead to a logical but incorrect conclusion."

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,78,"This would be an example of inductive reasoning, and, clearly, the existence of strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi demonstrate that this generalization is not correct despite it being based on a number of direct observations."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,79,"Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which in turn generate hypotheses that are tested with deductive reasoning."

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,81,"For example, case studies, which you will read about in the next section, are heavily weighted on the side of empirical observations."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,82,"Thus, case studies are closely associated with inductive processes as researchers gather massive amounts of observations and seek interesting patterns (new ideas) in the data."

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,86,A  theory  is a well-developed set of ideas that propose an explanation for observed phenomena.
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,87,"Theories are repeatedly checked against the world, but they tend to be too complex to be tested all at once; instead, researchers create hypotheses to test specific aspects of a theory."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,88,"A  hypothesis  is a testable prediction about how the world will behave if our idea is correct, and it is often worded as an if-then statement (e.g., if I study all night, I will get a passing grade on the test)."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,89,The hypothesis is extremely important because it bridges the gap between the realm of ideas and the real world.

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,92,"To see how this process works, let's consider a specific theory and a hypothesis that might be generated from that theory."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,93,"As you'll learn in a later chapter, the James-Lange theory of emotion asserts that emotional experience relies on the physiological arousal associated with the emotional state."

1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,95,"According to the James-Lange theory, these physiological changes would result in your feeling of fear."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,96,A hypothesis that could be derived from this theory might be that a person who is unaware of the physiological arousal that the sight of the snake elicits will not feel fear.
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,97,"A scientific hypothesis is also  falsifiable , or capable of being shown to be incorrect."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,98,Recall from the introductory chapter that Sigmund  Freud  had lots of interesting ideas to explain various human behaviors ( Figure 2.6 ).
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,99,"However, a major criticism of Freud's theories is that many of his ideas are not falsifiable; for example, it is impossible to imagine empirical observations that would disprove the existence of the id, the ego, and the superego—the three elements of personality described in Freud's theories."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,100,"Despite this, Freud's theories are widely taught in introductory psychology texts because of their historical significance for personality psychology and psychotherapy, and these remain the root of all modern forms of therapy."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,101,"Figure   2.6        Many of the specifics of (a) Freud's theories, such as (b) his division of the mind into id, ego, and superego, have fallen out of favor in recent decades because they are not falsifiable."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,102,"In broader strokes, his views set the stage for much of psychological thinking today, such as the unconscious nature of the majority of psychological processes."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,103,"In contrast, the James-Lange theory does generate falsifiable hypotheses, such as the one described above."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,104,Some individuals who suffer significant injuries to their spinal columns are unable to feel the bodily changes that often accompany emotional experiences.
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,105,"Therefore, we could test the hypothesis by determining how emotional experiences differ between individuals who have the ability to detect these changes in their physiological arousal and those who do not."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,106,"In fact, this research has been conducted and while the emotional experiences of people deprived of an awareness of their physiological arousal may be less intense, they still experience emotion (Chwalisz, Diener, &amp; Gallagher, 1988)."
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,107,Scientific research's dependence on falsifiability allows for great confidence in the information that it produces.
1e9e7330-5601-4832-9407-ea89af15113e@16,2,2,,108,"Typically, by the time information is accepted by the scientific community, it has been tested repeatedly."

88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,1,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Describe the different research methods used by psychologists   Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys, and archival research   Compare longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to research       There are many research methods available to psychologists in their efforts to understand, describe, and explain behavior and the cognitive and biological processes that underlie it."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,2,Some methods rely on observational techniques.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,3,"Other approaches involve interactions between the researcher and the individuals who are being studied—ranging from a series of simple questions to extensive, in-depth interviews—to well-controlled experiments."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,4,"Each of these research methods has unique strengths and weaknesses, and each method may only be appropriate for certain types of research questions."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,5,"For example, studies that rely primarily on observation produce incredible amounts of information, but the ability to apply this information to the larger population is somewhat limited because of small sample sizes."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,6,"Survey research, on the other hand, allows researchers to easily collect data from relatively large samples."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,7,"While this allows for results to be generalized to the larger population more easily, the information that can be collected on any given survey is somewhat limited and subject to problems associated with any type of self-reported data."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,8,Some researchers conduct archival research by using existing records.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,9,"While this can be a fairly inexpensive way to collect data that can provide insight into a number of research questions, researchers using this approach have no control on how or what kind of data was collected."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,10,All of the methods described thus far are correlational in nature.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,11,This means that researchers can speak to important relationships that might exist between two or more variables of interest.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,12,"However, correlational data cannot be used to make claims about cause-and-effect relationships."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,13,"Correlational research can find a relationship between two variables, but the only way a researcher can claim that the relationship between the variables is cause and effect is to perform an experiment."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,14,"In experimental research, which will be discussed later in this chapter, there is a tremendous amount of control over variables of interest."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,15,"While this is a powerful approach, experiments are often conducted in very artificial settings."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,16,This calls into question the validity of experimental findings with regard to how they would apply in real-world settings.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,17,"In addition, many of the questions that psychologists would like to answer cannot be pursued through experimental research because of ethical concerns."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,18,"Clinical or Case Studies    In 2011, the  New York Times  published a feature story on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, Canadian twin girls."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,19,"These particular twins are unique because Krista and Tatiana are conjoined twins, connected at the head."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,20,"There is evidence that the two girls are connected in a part of the brain called the thalamus, which is a major sensory relay center."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,21,Most incoming sensory information is sent through the thalamus before reaching higher regions of the cerebral cortex for processing.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,22,"Link to Learning     To learn more about Krista and Tatiana, watch this   New York Times  video  about their lives."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,23,The implications of this potential connection mean that it might be possible for one twin to experience the sensations of the other twin.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,24,"For instance, if Krista is watching a particularly funny television program, Tatiana might smile or laugh even if she is not watching the program."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,25,This particular possibility has piqued the interest of many neuroscientists who seek to understand how the brain uses sensory information.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,26,"These twins represent an enormous resource in the study of the brain, and since their condition is very rare, it is likely that as long as their family agrees, scientists will follow these girls very closely throughout their lives to gain as much information as possible (Dominus, 2011)."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,27,"In observational research, scientists are conducting a  clinical  or  case study  when they focus on one person or just a few individuals."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,28,"Indeed, some scientists spend their entire careers studying just 10–20 individuals."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,29,Why would they do this?
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,30,"Obviously, when they focus their attention on a very small number of people, they can gain a tremendous amount of insight into those cases."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,31,The richness of information that is collected in clinical or case studies is unmatched by any other single research method.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,32,This allows the researcher to have a very deep understanding of the individuals and the particular phenomenon being studied.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,33,"If clinical or case studies provide so much information, why are they not more frequent among researchers?"
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,34,"As it turns out, the major benefit of this particular approach is also a weakness."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,35,"As mentioned earlier, this approach is often used when studying individuals who are interesting to researchers because they have a rare characteristic."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,36,"Therefore, the individuals who serve as the focus of case studies are not like most other people."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,37,"If scientists ultimately want to explain all behavior, focusing attention on such a special group of people can make it difficult to generalize any observations to the larger population as a whole."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,38,Generalizing  refers to the ability to apply the findings of a particular research project to larger segments of society.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,39,"Again, case studies provide enormous amounts of information, but since the cases are so specific, the potential to apply what's learned to the average person may be very limited."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,40,"Naturalistic Observation   If you want to understand how behavior occurs, one of the best ways to gain information is to simply observe the behavior in its natural context."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,41,"However, people might change their behavior in unexpected ways if they know they are being observed."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,42,How do researchers obtain accurate information when people tend to hide their natural behavior?
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,43,"As an example, imagine that your professor asks everyone in your class to raise their hand if they always wash their hands after using the restroom."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,44,"Chances are that almost everyone in the classroom will raise their hand, but do you think hand washing after every trip to the restroom is really that universal?"
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,45,This is very similar to the phenomenon mentioned earlier in this chapter: many individuals do not feel comfortable answering a question honestly.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,46,"But if we are committed to finding out the facts about hand washing, we have other options available to us."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,47,Suppose we send a classmate into the restroom to actually watch whether everyone washes their hands after using the restroom.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,48,"Will our observer blend into the restroom environment by wearing a white lab coat, sitting with a clipboard, and staring at the sinks?"
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,49,We want our researcher to be inconspicuous—perhaps standing at one of the sinks pretending to put in contact lenses while secretly recording the relevant information.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,50,This type of observational study is called  naturalistic observation : observing behavior in its natural setting.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,51,"To better understand peer exclusion, Suzanne Fanger collaborated with colleagues at the University of Texas to observe the behavior of preschool children on a playground."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,52,How did the observers remain inconspicuous over the duration of the study?
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,53,They equipped a few of the children with wireless microphones (which the children quickly forgot about) and observed while taking notes from a distance.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,54,"Also, the children in that particular preschool (a ""laboratory preschool"") were accustomed to having observers on the playground (Fanger, Frankel, &amp; Hazen, 2012)."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,55,"It is critical that the observer be as unobtrusive and as inconspicuous as possible: when people know they are being watched, they are less likely to behave naturally."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,56,"If you have any doubt about this, ask yourself how your driving behavior might differ in two situations: In the first situation, you are driving down a deserted highway during the middle of the day; in the second situation, you are being followed by a police car down the same deserted highway ( Figure 2.7 )."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,57,Figure   2.7        Seeing a police car behind you would probably affect your driving behavior.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,58,It should be pointed out that naturalistic observation is not limited to research involving humans.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,59,"Indeed, some of the best-known examples of naturalistic observation involve researchers going into the field to observe various kinds of animals in their own environments."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,60,"As with human studies, the researchers maintain their distance and avoid interfering with the animal subjects so as not to influence their natural behaviors."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,61,Scientists have used this technique to study social hierarchies and interactions among animals ranging from ground squirrels to gorillas.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,62,The information provided by these studies is invaluable in understanding how those animals organize socially and communicate with one another.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,63,"The anthropologist Jane  Goodall , for example, spent nearly five decades observing the behavior of chimpanzees in Africa ( Figure 2.8 )."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,64,"As an illustration of the types of concerns that a researcher might encounter in naturalistic observation, some scientists criticized Goodall for giving the chimps names instead of referring to them by numbers—using names was thought to undermine the emotional detachment required for the objectivity of the study (McKie, 2010)."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,65,Figure   2.8        (a) Jane Goodall made a career of conducting naturalistic observations of (b) chimpanzee behavior.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,66,"The greatest benefit of naturalistic observation is the  validity , or accuracy, of information collected unobtrusively in a natural setting."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,67,"Having individuals behave as they normally would in a given situation means that we have a higher degree of ecological validity, or realism, than we might achieve with other research approaches."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,68,"Therefore, our ability to generalize the findings of the research to real-world situations is enhanced."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,69,"If done correctly, we need not worry about people or animals modifying their behavior simply because they are being observed."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,70,"Sometimes, people may assume that reality programs give us a glimpse into authentic human behavior."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,71,"However, the principle of inconspicuous observation is violated as reality stars are followed by camera crews and are interviewed on camera for personal confessionals."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,72,"Given that environment, we must doubt how natural and realistic their behaviors are."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,73,The major downside of naturalistic observation is that they are often difficult to set up and control.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,74,"In our restroom study, what if you stood in the restroom all day prepared to record people's hand washing behavior and no one came in?"
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,75,"Or, what if you have been closely observing a troop of gorillas for weeks only to find that they migrated to a new place while you were sleeping in your tent?"
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,76,The benefit of realistic data comes at a cost.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,77,As a researcher you have no control of when (or if) you have behavior to observe.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,78,"In addition, this type of observational research often requires significant investments of time, money, and a good dose of luck."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,79,Sometimes studies involve structured observation.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,80,"In these cases, people are observed while engaging in set, specific tasks."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,81,An excellent example of structured observation comes from Strange Situation by Mary Ainsworth (you will read more about this in the chapter on lifespan development).
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,82,The Strange Situation is a procedure used to evaluate attachment styles that exist between an infant and caregiver.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,83,"In this scenario, caregivers bring their infants into a room filled with toys."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,84,"The Strange Situation involves a number of phases, including a stranger coming into the room, the caregiver leaving the room, and the caregiver's return to the room."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,85,"The infant's behavior is closely monitored at each phase, but it is the behavior of the infant upon being reunited with the caregiver that is most telling in terms of characterizing the infant's attachment style with the caregiver."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,86,Another potential problem in observational research is  observer bias .
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,87,"Generally, people who act as observers are closely involved in the research project and may unconsciously skew their observations to fit their research goals or expectations."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,88,"To protect against this type of bias, researchers should have clear criteria established for the types of behaviors recorded and how those behaviors should be classified."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,89,"In addition, researchers often compare observations of the same event by multiple observers, in order to test  inter-rater reliability : a measure of reliability that assesses the consistency of observations by different observers."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,90,"Surveys   Often, psychologists develop surveys as a means of gathering data."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,91,"Surveys  are lists of questions to be answered by research participants, and can be delivered as paper-and-pencil questionnaires, administered electronically, or conducted verbally ( Figure 2.9 )."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,92,"Generally, the survey itself can be completed in a short time, and the ease of administering a survey makes it easy to collect data from a large number of people."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,93,Surveys allow researchers to gather data from larger samples than may be afforded by other research methods .
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,94,"A  sample  is a subset of individuals selected from a  population , which is the overall group of individuals that the researchers are interested in."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,95,Researchers study the sample and seek to generalize their findings to the population.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,96,"Figure   2.9        Surveys can be administered in a number of ways, including electronically administered research, like the survey shown here."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,97,There is both strength and weakness of the survey in comparison to case studies.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,98,"By using surveys, we can collect information from a larger sample of people."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,99,"A larger sample is better able to reflect the actual diversity of the population, thus allowing better generalizability."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,100,"Therefore, if our sample is sufficiently large and diverse, we can assume that the data we collect from the survey can be generalized to the larger population with more certainty than the information collected through a case study."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,101,"However, given the greater number of people involved, we are not able to collect the same depth of information on each person that would be collected in a case study."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,102,Another potential weakness of surveys is something we touched on earlier in this chapter: People don't always give accurate responses.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,103,"They may lie, misremember, or answer questions in a way that they think makes them look good."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,104,"For example, people may report drinking less alcohol than is actually the case."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,105,Any number of research questions can be answered through the use of surveys.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,106,"One real-world example is the research conducted by Jenkins, Ruppel, Kizer, Yehl, and Griffin (2012) about the backlash against the US Arab-American community following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,107,Jenkins and colleagues wanted to determine to what extent these negative attitudes toward Arab-Americans still existed nearly a decade after the attacks occurred.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,108,"In one study, 140 research participants filled out a survey with 10 questions, including questions asking directly about the participant's overt prejudicial attitudes toward people of various ethnicities."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,109,"The survey also asked indirect questions about how likely the participant would be to interact with a person of a given ethnicity in a variety of settings (such as, ""How likely do you think it is that you would introduce yourself to a person of Arab-American descent?"")."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,110,The results of the research suggested that participants were unwilling to report prejudicial attitudes toward any ethnic group.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,111,"However, there were significant differences between their pattern of responses to questions about social interaction with Arab-Americans compared to other ethnic groups: they indicated less willingness for social interaction with Arab-Americans compared to the other ethnic groups."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,112,"This suggested that the participants harbored subtle forms of prejudice against Arab-Americans, despite their assertions that this was not the case (Jenkins et al., 2012)."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,113,Archival Research   Some researchers gain access to large amounts of data without interacting with a single research participant.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,114,"Instead, they use existing records to answer various research questions."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,115,This type of research approach is known as  archival research .
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,116,Archival research relies on looking at past records or data sets to look for interesting patterns or relationships.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,117,"For example, a researcher might access the academic records of all individuals who enrolled in college within the past ten years and calculate how long it took them to complete their degrees, as well as course loads, grades, and extracurricular involvement."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,118,"Archival research could provide important information about who is most likely to complete their education, and it could help identify important risk factors for struggling students ( Figure 2.10 )."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,119,"Figure   2.10        A researcher doing archival research examines records, whether archived as a (a) hardcopy or (b) electronically."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,120,"In comparing archival research to other research methods, there are several important distinctions."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,121,"For one, the researcher employing archival research never directly interacts with research participants."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,122,"Therefore, the investment of time and money to collect data is considerably less with archival research."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,123,"Additionally, researchers have no control over what information was originally collected."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,124,"Therefore, research questions have to be tailored so they can be answered within the structure of the existing data sets."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,125,"There is also no guarantee of consistency between the records from one source to another, which might make comparing and contrasting different data sets problematic."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,126,"Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional Research    Sometimes we want to see how people change over time, as in studies of human development and lifespan."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,127,"When we test the same group of individuals repeatedly over an extended period of time, we are conducting longitudinal research."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,128,Longitudinal research  is a research design in which data-gathering is administered repeatedly over an extended period of time.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,129,"For example, we may survey a group of individuals about their dietary habits at age 20, retest them a decade later at age 30, and then again at age 40."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,130,Another approach is cross-sectional research.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,131,"In  cross-sectional research , a researcher compares multiple segments of the population at the same time."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,132,"Using the dietary habits example above, the researcher might directly compare different groups of people by age."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,133,"Instead a group of people for 20 years to see how their dietary habits changed from decade to decade, the researcher would study a group of 20-year-old individuals and compare them to a group of 30-year-old individuals and a group of 40-year-old individuals."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,134,"While cross-sectional research requires a shorter-term investment, it is also limited by differences that exist between the different generations (or cohorts) that have nothing to do with age per se, but rather reflect the social and cultural experiences of different generations of individuals make them different from one another."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,135,"To illustrate this concept, consider the following survey findings."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,136,In recent years there has been significant growth in the popular support of same-sex marriage.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,137,Many studies on this topic break down survey participants into different age groups.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,138,"In general, younger people are more supportive of same-sex marriage than are those who are older (Jones, 2013)."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,139,"Does this mean that as we age we become less open to the idea of same-sex marriage, or does this mean that older individuals have different perspectives because of the social climates in which they grew up?"
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,140,"Longitudinal research is a powerful approach because the same individuals are involved in the research project over time, which means that the researchers need to be less concerned with differences among cohorts affecting the results of their study."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,141,Often longitudinal studies are employed when researching various diseases in an effort to understand particular risk factors.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,142,Such studies often involve tens of thousands of individuals who are followed for several decades.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,143,"Given the enormous number of people involved in these studies, researchers can feel confident that their findings can be generalized to the larger population."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,144,The Cancer Prevention Study-3 (CPS-3) is one of a series of longitudinal studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society aimed at determining predictive risk factors associated with cancer.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,145,"When participants enter the study, they complete a survey about their lives and family histories, providing information on factors that might cause or prevent the development of cancer."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,146,Then every few years the participants receive additional surveys to complete.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,147,"In the end, hundreds of thousands of participants will be tracked over 20 years to determine which of them develop cancer and which do not."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,148,"Clearly, this type of research is important and potentially very informative."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,149,"For instance, earlier longitudinal studies sponsored by the American Cancer Society provided some of the first scientific demonstrations of the now well-established links between increased rates of cancer and smoking (American Cancer Society, n.d.) ( Figure 2.11 )."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,150,Figure   2.11        Longitudinal research like the CPS-3 help us to better understand how smoking is associated with cancer and other diseases.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,151,"As with any research strategy, longitudinal research is not without limitations."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,152,"For one, these studies require an incredible time investment by the researcher and research participants."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,153,"Given that some longitudinal studies take years, if not decades, to complete, the results will not be known for a considerable period of time."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,154,"In addition to the time demands, these studies also require a substantial financial investment."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,155,Many researchers are unable to commit the resources necessary to see a longitudinal project through to the end.
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,156,"Research participants must also be willing to continue their participation for an extended period of time, and this can be problematic."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,157,"People move, get married and take new names, get ill, and eventually die."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,158,"Even without significant life changes, some people may simply choose to discontinue their participation in the project."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,159,"As a result, the  attrition  rates, or reduction in the number of research participants due to dropouts, in longitudinal studies are quite high and increases over the course of a project."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,160,"For this reason, researchers using this approach typically recruit many participants fully expecting that a substantial number will drop out before the end."
88cc8564-9ce0-45f2-958c-5ccab289f902@11,2,3,Approaches to Research,161,"As the study progresses, they continually check whether the sample still represents the larger population, and make adjustments as necessary."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,1,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Explain what a correlation coefficient tells us about the relationship between variables   Recognize that correlation does not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship between variables   Discuss our tendency to look for relationships between variables that do not really exist   Explain random sampling and assignment of participants into experimental and control groups   Discuss how experimenter or participant bias could affect the results of an experiment   Identify independent and dependent variables       Did you know that as sales in ice cream increase, so does the overall rate of crime?"
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,2,Is it possible that indulging in your favorite flavor of ice cream could send you on a crime spree?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,3,"Or, after committing crime do you think you might decide to treat yourself to a cone?"
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,4,"There is no question that a relationship exists between ice cream and crime (e.g., Harper, 2013), but it would be pretty foolish to decide that one thing actually caused the other to occur."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,5,It is much more likely that both ice cream sales and crime rates are related to the temperature outside.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,6,"When the temperature is warm, there are lots of people out of their houses, interacting with each other, getting annoyed with one another, and sometimes committing crimes."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,7,"Also, when it is warm outside, we are more likely to seek a cool treat like ice cream."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,8,How do we determine if there is indeed a relationship between two things?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,9,"And when there is a relationship, how can we discern whether it is attributable to coincidence or causation?"
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,10,"Correlational Research    Correlation  means that there is a relationship between two or more variables (such as ice cream consumption and crime), but this relationship does not necessarily imply cause and effect."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,11,"When two variables are correlated, it simply means that as one variable changes, so does the other."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,12,We can measure correlation by calculating a statistic known as a correlation coefficient.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,13,A  correlation coefficient  is a number from -1 to +1 that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,14,The correlation coefficient is usually represented by the letter  r .
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,15,The number portion of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,16,"The closer the number is to 1 (be it negative or positive), the more strongly related the variables are, and the more predictable changes in one variable will be as the other variable changes."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,17,"The closer the number is to zero, the weaker the relationship, and the less predictable the relationships between the variables becomes."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,18,"For instance, a correlation coefficient of 0.9 indicates a far stronger relationship than a correlation coefficient of 0.3."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,19,"If the variables are not related to one another at all, the correlation coefficient is 0."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,20,The example above about ice cream and crime is an example of two variables that we might expect to have no relationship to each other.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,21,The sign—positive or negative—of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship ( Figure 2.12 ).
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,22,A  positive correlation  means that the variables move in the same direction.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,23,"Put another way, it means that as one variable increases so does the other, and conversely, when one variable decreases so does the other."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,24,A  negative correlation  means that the variables move in opposite directions.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,25,"If two variables are negatively correlated, a decrease in one variable is associated with an increase in the other and vice versa."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,26,The example of ice cream and crime rates is a positive correlation because both variables increase when temperatures are warmer.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,27,Other examples of positive correlations are the relationship between an individual's height and weight or the relationship between a person's age and number of wrinkles.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,28,One might expect a negative correlation to exist between someone's tiredness during the day and the number of hours they slept the previous night: the amount of sleep decreases as the feelings of tiredness increase.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,29,"In a real-world example of negative correlation, student researchers at the University of Minnesota found a weak negative correlation ( r  = -0.29) between the average number of days per week that students got fewer than 5 hours of sleep and their GPA (Lowry, Dean, &amp; Manders, 2010)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,30,Keep in mind that a negative correlation is not the same as no correlation.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,31,"For example, we would probably find no correlation between hours of sleep and shoe size."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,32,"As mentioned earlier, correlations have predictive value."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,33,Imagine that you are on the admissions committee of a major university.

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,42,Correlation Does Not Indicate Causation    Correlational research is useful because it allows us to discover the strength and direction of relationships that exist between two variables.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,43,"However, correlation is limited because establishing the existence of a relationship tells us little about  cause and effect ."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,44,"While variables are sometimes correlated because one does cause the other, it could also be that some other factor, a  confounding variable , is actually causing the systematic movement in our variables of interest."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,45,"In the ice cream/crime rate example mentioned earlier, temperature is a confounding variable that could account for the relationship between the two variables."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,46,"Even when we cannot point to clear confounding variables, we should not assume that a correlation between two variables implies that one variable causes changes in another."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,47,This can be frustrating when a cause-and-effect relationship seems clear and intuitive.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,48,Think back to our discussion of the research done by the American Cancer Society and how their research projects were some of the first demonstrations of the link between smoking and cancer.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,49,"It seems reasonable to assume that smoking causes cancer, but if we were limited to  correlational research , we would be overstepping our bounds by making this assumption."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,50,"Unfortunately, people mistakenly make claims of causation as a function of correlations all the time."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,53,Guess how the cereal companies report this finding.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,54,"Does eating cereal really cause an individual to maintain a healthy weight, or are there other possible explanations, such as, someone at a healthy weight is more likely to regularly eat a healthy breakfast than someone who is obese or someone who avoids meals in an attempt to diet ( Figure 2.13 )?"
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,55,"While correlational research is invaluable in identifying relationships among variables, a major limitation is the inability to establish causality."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,56,"Psychologists want to make statements about cause and effect, but the only way to do that is to conduct an experiment to answer a research question."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,57,"The next section describes how scientific experiments incorporate methods that eliminate, or control for, alternative explanations, which allow researchers to explore how changes in one variable cause changes in another variable."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,60,"We also tend to make the mistake of illusory correlations, especially with unsystematic observations."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,61,"Illusory correlations , or false correlations, occur when people believe that relationships exist between two things when no such relationship exists."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,66,The ebb and flow of the ocean's tides are tightly tied to the gravitational forces of the moon.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,67,"Many people believe, therefore, that it is logical that we are affected by the moon as well."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,71,Why are we so apt to believe in illusory correlations like this?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,72,Often we read or hear about them and simply accept the information as valid.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,73,"Or, we have a hunch about how something works and then look for evidence to support that hunch, ignoring evidence that would tell us our hunch is false; this is known as  confirmation bias ."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,74,"Other times, we find illusory correlations based on the information that comes most easily to mind, even if that information is severely limited."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,75,"And while we may feel confident that we can use these relationships to better understand and predict the world around us, illusory correlations can have significant drawbacks."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,76,"For example, research suggests that illusory correlations—in which certain behaviors are inaccurately attributed to certain groups—are involved in the formation of prejudicial attitudes that can ultimately lead to discriminatory behavior (Fiedler, 2004)."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,78,Experiment has a different meaning in the scientific context than in everyday life.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,79,"In everyday conversation, we often use it to describe trying something for the first time, such as experimenting with a new hair style or a new food."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,80,"However, in the scientific context, an experiment has precise requirements for design and implementation."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,81,"The Experimental Hypothesis   In order to conduct an experiment, a researcher must have a specific  hypothesis  to be tested."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,82,"As you've learned, hypotheses can be formulated either through direct observation of the real world or after careful review of previous research."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,83,"For example, if you think that children should not be allowed to watch violent programming on television because doing so would cause them to behave more violently, then you have basically formulated a hypothesis—namely, that watching violent television programs causes children to behave more violently."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,84,How might you have arrived at this particular hypothesis?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,85,"You may have younger relatives who watch cartoons featuring characters using martial arts to save the world from evildoers, with an impressive array of punching, kicking, and defensive postures."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,86,"You notice that after watching these programs for a while, your young relatives mimic the fighting behavior of the characters portrayed in the cartoon ( Figure 2.15 )."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,87,Figure   2.15        Seeing behavior like this right after a child watches violent television programming might lead you to hypothesize that viewing violent television programming leads to an increase in the display of violent behaviors.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,88,"These sorts of personal observations are what often lead us to formulate a specific hypothesis, but we cannot use limited personal observations and anecdotal evidence to rigorously test our hypothesis."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,89,"Instead, to find out if real-world data supports our hypothesis, we have to conduct an experiment."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,90,Designing an Experiment   The most basic experimental design involves two groups: the experimental group and the control group.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,91,The two groups are designed to be the same except for one difference— experimental manipulation.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,92,"The  experimental group  gets the experimental manipulation—that is, the treatment or variable being tested (in this case, violent TV images)—and the  control group  does not."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,93,"Since experimental manipulation is the only difference between the experimental and control groups, we can be sure that any differences between the two are due to experimental manipulation rather than chance."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,94,"In our example of how violent television programming might affect violent behavior in children, we have the experimental group view violent television programming for a specified time and then measure their violent behavior."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,95,We measure the violent behavior in our control group after they watch nonviolent television programming for the same amount of time.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,96,"It is important for the control group to be treated similarly to the experimental group, with the exception that the control group does not receive the experimental manipulation."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,97,"Therefore, we have the control group watch non-violent television programming for the same amount of time as the experimental group."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,98,"We also need to precisely define, or operationalize, what is considered violent and nonviolent."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,99,"An  operational definition  is a description of how we will measure our variables, and it is important in allowing others understand exactly how and what a researcher measures in a particular experiment."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,100,"In operationalizing violent behavior, we might choose to count only physical acts like kicking or punching as instances of this behavior, or we also may choose to include angry verbal exchanges."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,101,"Whatever we determine, it is important that we operationalize violent behavior in such a way that anyone who hears about our study for the first time knows exactly what we mean by violence."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,102,This aids peoples' ability to interpret our data as well as their capacity to repeat our experiment should they choose to do so.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,103,"Once we have operationalized what is considered violent television programming and what is considered violent behavior from our experiment participants, we need to establish how we will run our experiment."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,104,"In this case, we might have participants watch a 30-minute television program (either violent or nonviolent, depending on their group membership) before sending them out to a playground for an hour where their behavior is observed and the number and type of violent acts is recorded."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,105,"Ideally, the people who observe and record the children's behavior are unaware of who was assigned to the experimental or control group, in order to control for experimenter bias."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,106,Experimenter bias  refers to the possibility that a researcher's expectations might skew the results of the study.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,107,"Remember, conducting an experiment requires a lot of planning, and the people involved in the research project have a vested interest in supporting their hypotheses."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,108,"If the observers knew which child was in which group, it might influence how much attention they paid to each child's behavior as well as how they interpreted that behavior."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,109,"By being blind to which child is in which group, we protect against those biases."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,110,"This situation is a  single-blind study , meaning that one of the groups (participants) are unaware as to which group they are in (experiment or control group) while the researcher who developed the experiment knows which participants are in each group."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,111,"In a  double-blind study , both the researchers and the participants are blind to group assignments."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,112,Why would a researcher want to run a study where no one knows who is in which group?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,113,"Because by doing so, we can control for both experimenter and participant expectations."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,114,"If you are familiar with the phrase  placebo effect , you already have some idea as to why this is an important consideration."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,115,The placebo effect occurs when people's expectations or beliefs influence or determine their experience in a given situation.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,116,"In other words, simply expecting something to happen can actually make it happen."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,117,The placebo effect is commonly described in terms of testing the effectiveness of a new medication.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,118,"Imagine that you work in a pharmaceutical company, and you think you have a new drug that is effective in treating depression."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,119,"To demonstrate that your medication is effective, you run an experiment with two groups: The experimental group receives the medication, and the control group does not."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,120,But you don't want participants to know whether they received the drug or not.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,121,Why is that?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,122,"Imagine that you are a participant in this study, and you have just taken a pill that you think will improve your mood."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,123,"Because you expect the pill to have an effect, you might feel better simply because you took the pill and not because of any drug actually contained in the pill—this is the placebo effect."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,124,"To make sure that any effects on mood are due to the drug and not due to expectations, the control group receives a placebo (in this case a sugar pill)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,125,"Now everyone gets a pill, and once again neither the researcher nor the experimental participants know who got the drug and who got the sugar pill."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,126,Any differences in mood between the experimental and control groups can now be attributed to the drug itself rather than to experimenter bias or participant expectations ( Figure 2.16 ).
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,127,Figure   2.16        Providing the control group with a placebo treatment protects against bias caused by expectancy.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,128,"Independent and Dependent Variables   In a research experiment, we strive to study whether changes in one thing cause changes in another."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,129,"To achieve this, we must pay attention to two important variables, or things that can be changed, in any experimental study: the independent variable and the dependent variable."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,130,An  independent variable  is manipulated or controlled by the experimenter.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,131,"In a well-designed experimental study, the independent variable is the only important difference between the experimental and control groups."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,132,"In our example of how violent television programs affect children's display of violent behavior, the independent variable is the type of program—violent or nonviolent—viewed by participants in the study ( Figure 2.17 )."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,133,A  dependent variable  is what the researcher measures to see how much effect the independent variable had.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,134,"In our example, the dependent variable is the number of violent acts displayed by the experimental participants."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,136,We expect that the dependent variable will change as a function of the independent variable.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,137,"In other words, the dependent variable  depends  on the independent variable."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,138,A good way to think about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is with this question: What effect does the independent variable have on the dependent variable?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,139,"Returning to our example, what effect does watching a half hour of violent television programming or nonviolent television programming have on the number of incidents of physical aggression displayed on the playground?"
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,140,"Selecting and Assigning Experimental Participants   Now that our study is designed, we need to obtain a sample of individuals to include in our experiment."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,141,Our study involves human participants so we need to determine who to include.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,142,"Participants  are the subjects of psychological research, and as the name implies, individuals who are involved in psychological research actively participate in the process."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,143,"Often, psychological research projects rely on college students to serve as participants."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,144,"In fact, the vast majority of research in psychology subfields has historically involved students as research participants (Sears, 1986; Arnett, 2008)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,145,But are college students truly representative of the general population?
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,146,"College students tend to be younger, more educated, more liberal, and less diverse than the general population."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,147,"Although using students as test subjects is an accepted practice, relying on such a limited pool of research participants can be problematic because it is difficult to generalize findings to the larger population."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,148,"Our hypothetical experiment involves children, and we must first generate a sample of child participants."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,149,Samples are used because populations are usually too large to reasonably involve every member in our particular experiment ( Figure 2.18 ).
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,150,"If possible, we should use a random sample (there are other types of samples, but for the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on random samples)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,151,A  random sample  is a subset of a larger population in which every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,152,Random samples are preferred because if the sample is large enough we can be reasonably sure that the participating individuals are representative of the larger population.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,153,"This means that the percentages of characteristics in the sample—sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic level, and any other characteristics that might affect the results—are close to those percentages in the larger population."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,154,"In our example, let's say we decide our population of interest is fourth graders."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,155,"But all fourth graders is a very large population, so we need to be more specific; instead we might say our population of interest is all fourth graders in a particular city."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,156,"We should include students from various income brackets, family situations, races, ethnicities, religions, and geographic areas of town."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,157,"With this more manageable population, we can work with the local schools in selecting a random sample of around 200 fourth graders who we want to participate in our experiment."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,158,"In summary, because we cannot test all of the fourth graders in a city, we want to find a group of about 200 that reflects the composition of that city."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,159,"With a representative group, we can generalize our findings to the larger population without fear of our sample being biased in some way."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,160,Figure   2.18        Researchers may work with (a) a large population or (b) a sample group that is a subset of the larger population.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,161,"Now that we have a sample, the next step of the experimental process is to split the participants into experimental and control groups through random assignment."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,162,"With  random assignment , all participants have an equal chance of being assigned to either group."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,163,There is statistical software that will randomly assign each of the fourth graders in the sample to either the experimental or the control group.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,164,Random assignment is critical for sound  experimental design .
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,165,"With sufficiently large samples, random assignment makes it unlikely that there are systematic differences between the groups."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,166,"So, for instance, it would be very unlikely that we would get one group composed entirely of males, a given ethnic identity, or a given religious ideology."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,167,"This is important because if the groups were systematically different before the experiment began, we would not know the origin of any differences we find between the groups: Were the differences preexisting, or were they caused by manipulation of the independent variable?"
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,168,Random assignment allows us to assume that any differences observed between experimental and control groups result from the manipulation of the independent variable.

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,171,"True experiments require the experimenter to manipulate an independent variable, and that can complicate many questions that psychologists might want to address."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,172,"For instance, imagine that you want to know what effect sex (the independent variable) has on spatial memory (the dependent variable)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,173,"Although you can certainly look for differences between males and females on a task that taps into spatial memory, you cannot directly control a person's sex."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,174,We categorize this type of research approach as quasi-experimental and recognize that we cannot make cause-and-effect claims in these circumstances.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,175,Experimenters are also limited by ethical constraints.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,176,"For instance, you would not be able to conduct an experiment designed to determine if experiencing abuse as a child leads to lower levels of self-esteem among adults."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,177,"To conduct such an experiment, you would need to randomly assign some experimental participants to a group that receives abuse, and that experiment would be unethical."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,178,"Interpreting Experimental Findings   Once data is collected from both the experimental and the control groups, a  statistical analysis  is conducted to find out if there are meaningful differences between the two groups."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,179,A statistical analysis determines how likely any difference found is due to chance (and thus not meaningful).
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,180,"In psychology, group differences are considered meaningful, or significant, if the odds that these differences occurred by chance alone are 5 percent or less."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,181,"Stated another way, if we repeated this experiment 100 times, we would expect to find the same results at least 95 times out of 100."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,182,The greatest strength of experiments is the ability to assert that any significant differences in the findings are caused by the independent variable.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,183,"This occurs because random selection, random assignment, and a design that limits the effects of both experimenter bias and participant expectancy should create groups that are similar in composition and treatment."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,184,"Therefore, any difference between the groups is attributable to the independent variable, and now we can finally make a causal statement."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,185,"If we find that watching a violent television program results in more violent behavior than watching a nonviolent program, we can safely say that watching violent television programs causes an increase in the display of violent behavior."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,190,A peer-reviewed journal article is read by several other scientists (generally anonymously) with expertise in the subject matter.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,191,These peer reviewers provide feedback—to both the author and the journal editor—regarding the quality of the draft.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,192,"Peer reviewers look for a strong rationale for the research being described, a clear description of how the research was conducted, and evidence that the research was conducted in an ethical manner."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,193,"They also look for flaws in the study's design, methods, and statistical analyses."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,196,"This helps prevent unnecessary duplication of research findings in the scientific literature and, to some extent, ensures that each research article provides new information."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,197,"Ultimately, the journal editor will compile all of the peer reviewer feedback and determine whether the article will be published in its current state (a rare occurrence), published with revisions, or not accepted for publication."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,198,Peer review provides some degree of quality control for psychological research.

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,200,"Peer review also ensures that the research is described clearly enough to allow other scientists to  replicate  it, meaning they can repeat the experiment using different samples to determine reliability."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,201,Sometimes replications involve additional measures that expand on the original finding.

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,216,Reliability and Validity   Reliability and validity are two important considerations that must be made with any type of data collection.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,217,Reliability  refers to the ability to consistently produce a given result.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,218,"In the context of psychological research, this would mean that any instruments or tools used to collect data do so in consistent, reproducible ways."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,219,"Unfortunately, being consistent in measurement does not necessarily mean that you have measured something correctly."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,220,"To illustrate this concept, consider a kitchen scale that would be used to measure the weight of cereal that you eat in the morning."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,221,"If the scale is not properly calibrated, it may consistently under- or overestimate the amount of cereal that's being measured."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,222,"While the scale is highly reliable in producing consistent results (e.g., the same amount of cereal poured onto the scale produces the same reading each time), those results are incorrect."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,223,This is where validity comes into play.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,224,Validity  refers to the extent to which a given instrument or tool accurately measures what it's supposed to measure.
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,225,"While any valid measure is by necessity reliable, the reverse is not necessarily true."

99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,229,"Research conducted by the College Board suggests that scores on the SAT have high predictive validity for first-year college students' GPA (Kobrin, Patterson, Shaw, Mattern, &amp; Barbuti, 2008)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,230,"In this context, predictive validity refers to the test's ability to effectively predict the GPA of college freshmen."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,231,"Given that many institutions of higher education require the SAT for admission, this high degree of predictive validity might be comforting."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,232,"However, the emphasis placed on SAT scores in college admissions has generated some controversy on a number of fronts."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,233,"For one, some researchers assert that the SAT is a biased test that places minority students at a disadvantage and unfairly reduces the likelihood of being admitted into a college (Santelices &amp; Wilson, 2010)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,234,"Additionally, some research has suggested that the predictive validity of the SAT is grossly exaggerated in how well it is able to predict the GPA of first-year college students."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,235,"In fact, it has been suggested that the SAT's predictive validity may be overestimated by as much as 150% (Rothstein, 2004)."
99f02bc9-bc9e-405a-b300-2197f3ce3e96@16,2,4,Analyzing Findings,236,"Many institutions of higher education are beginning to consider de-emphasizing the significance of SAT scores in making admission decisions (Rimer, 2008)."

598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,3,Modern researchers must demonstrate that the research they perform is ethically sound.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,4,This section presents how ethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,5,"Research Involving Human Participants   Any experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive, strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,6,Any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an  institutional review board (IRB) .
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,7,"The IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution's administration, scientists, and community members ( Figure 2.20 )."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,8,The purpose of the IRB is to review proposals for research that involves human participants.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,9,"The IRB reviews these proposals with the principles mentioned above in mind, and generally, approval from the IRB is required in order for the experiment to proceed."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,10,Figure   2.20        An institution's IRB meets regularly to review experimental proposals that involve human participants.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,11,An institution's IRB requires several components in any experiment it approves.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,12,"For one, each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,13,"An  informed consent  form provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment, including potential risks and implications of the research."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,14,It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be discontinued without penalty at any time.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,15,"Furthermore, the informed consent guarantees that any data collected in the experiment will remain completely confidential."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,16,"In cases where research participants are under the age of 18, the parents or legal guardians are required to sign the informed consent form."

598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,18,"While the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing, sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants' knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,19,"Deception  involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment, but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,20,"For example, if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire, we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants' responses."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,21,"In cases where deception is involved, participants must receive a full  debriefing  upon conclusion of the study—complete, honest information about the purpose of the experiment, how the data collected will be used, the reasons why deception was necessary, and information about how to obtain additional information about the study."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,22,"Dig Deeper     Ethics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study   Unfortunately, the ethical guidelines that exist for research today were not always applied in the past."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,23,"In 1932, poor, rural, black, male sharecroppers from Tuskegee, Alabama, were recruited to participate in an experiment conducted by the U.S. Public Health Service, with the aim of studying syphilis in black men ( Figure 2.21 )."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,24,"In exchange for free medical care, meals, and burial insurance, 600 men agreed to participate in the study."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,25,"A little more than half of the men tested positive for syphilis, and they served as the experimental group (given that the researchers could not randomly assign participants to groups, this represents a quasi-experiment)."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,26,The remaining syphilis-free individuals served as the control group.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,27,"However, those individuals that tested positive for syphilis were never informed that they had the disease."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,28,"While there was no treatment for syphilis when the study began, by 1947 penicillin was recognized as an effective treatment for the disease."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,29,"Despite this, no penicillin was administered to the participants in this study, and the participants were not allowed to seek treatment at any other facilities if they continued in the study."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,30,"Over the course of 40 years, many of the participants unknowingly spread syphilis to their wives (and subsequently their children born from their wives) and eventually died because they never received treatment for the disease."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,31,"This study was discontinued in 1972 when the experiment was discovered by the national press (Tuskegee University, n.d.)."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,32,The resulting outrage over the experiment led directly to the National Research Act of 1974 and the strict ethical guidelines for research on humans described in this chapter.

598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,37,Research Involving Animal Subjects   Many psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,38,"Often, these researchers use rodents ( Figure 2.22 ) or birds as the subjects of their experiments—the APA estimates that 90% of all  animal research  in psychology uses these species (American Psychological Association, n.d.)."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,39,"Because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans, these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,40,"Figure   2.22        Rats, like the one shown here, often serve as the subjects of animal research."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,41,This does not mean that animal researchers are immune to ethical concerns.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,42,"Indeed, the humane and ethical treatment of animal research subjects is a critical aspect of this type of research."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,43,Researchers must design their experiments to minimize any pain or distress experienced by animals serving as research subjects.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,44,"Whereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants, animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an  Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) ."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,45,"An IACUC consists of institutional administrators, scientists, veterinarians, and community members."
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,46,This committee is charged with ensuring that all experimental proposals require the humane treatment of animal research subjects.
598b46d7-bb47-43f0-bb34-f1e90a3ebeb8@15,2,5,Ethics,47,It also conducts semi-annual inspections of all animal facilities to ensure that the research protocols are being followed.

bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,16,The explanation is illustrated with the following scenario.
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,17,"Imagine two young women—Luwi and Sena—sisters in rural Zambia, Africa."
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,18,Luwi carries the gene for sickle-cell anemia; Sena does not carry the gene.
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,19,Sickle-cell carriers have one copy of the sickle-cell gene but do not have full-blown sickle-cell anemia.
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,20,They experience symptoms only if they are severely dehydrated or are deprived of oxygen (as in mountain climbing).
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,21,"Carriers are thought to be immune from malaria (an often deadly disease that is widespread in tropical climates) because changes in their blood chemistry and immune functioning prevent the malaria parasite from having its effects (Gong, Parikh, Rosenthal, &amp; Greenhouse, 2013)."
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,22,"However, full-blown sickle-cell anemia, with two copies of the sickle-cell gene, does not provide immunity to malaria."

bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,31,This is precisely the situation that Charles  Darwin  describes in the  theory of evolution by natural selection  ( Figure 3.3 ).
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,32,"In simple terms, the theory states that organisms that are better suited for their environment will survive and reproduce, while those that are poorly suited for their environment will die off."
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,33,"In our example, we can see that as a carrier, Luwi's mutation is highly adaptive in her African homeland; however, if she resided in the United States (where malaria is much less common), her mutation could prove costly—with a high probability of the disease in her descendants and minor health problems of her own."

bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,104,"For example, if an individual's genetic makeup predisposes her to high levels of intellectual potential and she is reared in a rich, stimulating environment, then she will be more likely to achieve her full potential than if she were raised under conditions of significant deprivation."
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,105,"According to the concept of range of reaction, genes set definite limits on potential, and environment determines how much of that potential is achieved."
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,106,Some disagree with this theory and argue that genes do not set a limit on a person's potential.
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,107,Another perspective on the interaction between genes and the environment is the concept of  genetic environmental correlation .

bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,118,"For instance, identical twins share the same genetic information ( identical twins  develop from a single fertilized egg that split, so the genetic material is exactly the same in each; in contrast,  fraternal twins  develop from two different eggs fertilized by different sperm, so the genetic material varies as with non-twin siblings)."
bd0a70f3-ce1b-4656-8551-69afb19415e0@17,3,2,Human Genetics,119,"But even with identical genes, there remains an incredible amount of variability in how gene expression can unfold over the course of each twin's life."

48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,38,The neuronal membrane keeps these two fluids separate—a critical role because the electrical signal that passes through the neuron depends on the intra- and extracellular fluids being electrically different.
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,39,"This difference in charge across the membrane, called the  membrane potential , provides energy for the signal."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,40,The electrical charge of the fluids is caused by charged molecules (ions) dissolved in the fluid.
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,41,"The semipermeable nature of the neuronal membrane somewhat restricts the movement of these charged molecules, and, as a result, some of the charged particles tend to become more concentrated either inside or outside the cell."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,42,"Between signals, the neuron membrane's potential is held in a state of readiness, called the  resting potential ."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,43,"Like a rubber band stretched out and waiting to spring into action, ions line up on either side of the cell membrane, ready to rush across the membrane when the neuron goes active and the membrane opens its gates (i.e., a  sodium-potassium pump  that allows movement of ions across the membrane)."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,44,"Ions in high-concentration areas are ready to move to low-concentration areas, and positive ions are ready to move to areas with a negative charge."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,45,"In the resting state, sodium (Na + ) is at higher concentrations outside the cell, so it will tend to move into the cell."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,46,"Potassium (K + ), on the other hand, is more concentrated inside the cell, and will tend to move out of the cell ( Figure 3.10 )."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,47,"In addition, the inside of the cell is slightly negatively charged compared to the outside."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,48,"This provides an additional force on sodium, causing it to move into the cell."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,49,"Figure   3.10        At resting potential, Na +  (blue pentagons) is more highly concentrated outside the cell in the extracellular fluid (shown in blue), whereas K +  (purple squares) is more highly concentrated near the membrane in the cytoplasm or intracellular fluid."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,50,"Other molecules, such as chloride ions (yellow circles) and negatively charged proteins (brown squares), help contribute to a positive net charge in the extracellular fluid and a negative net charge in the intracellular fluid."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,51,"From this resting potential state, the neuron receives a signal and its state changes abruptly ( Figure 3.11 )."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,52,"When a neuron receives signals at the dendrites—due to neurotransmitters from an adjacent neuron binding to its receptors—small pores, or gates, open on the neuronal membrane, allowing Na +  ions, propelled by both charge and concentration differences, to move into the cell."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,53,"With this influx of positive ions, the internal charge of the cell becomes more positive."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,54,"If that charge reaches a certain level, called the  threshold of excitation , the neuron becomes active and the action potential begins."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,55,"Many additional pores open, causing a massive influx of Na +  ions and a huge positive spike in the membrane potential, the peak action potential."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,56,"At the peak of the spike, the sodium gates close and the potassium gates open."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,57,"As positively charged potassium ions leave, the cell quickly begins repolarization."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,58,"At first, it hyperpolarizes, becoming slightly more negative than the resting potential, and then it levels off, returning to the resting potential."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,59,"Figure   3.11        During the action potential, the electrical charge across the membrane changes dramatically."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,60,This positive spike constitutes the  action potential : the electrical signal that typically moves from the cell body down the axon to the axon terminals.
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,61,"The electrical signal moves down the axon like a wave; at each point, some of the sodium ions that enter the cell diffuse to the next section of the axon, raising the charge past the threshold of excitation and triggering a new influx of sodium ions."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,62,The action potential moves all the way down the axon to the terminal buttons.
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,63,The action potential is an  all-or-none  phenomenon.
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,64,"In simple terms, this means that an incoming signal from another neuron is either sufficient or insufficient to reach the threshold of excitation."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,65,"There is no in-between, and there is no turning off an action potential once it starts."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,66,Think of it like sending an email or a text message.
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,67,"You can think about sending it all you want, but the message is not sent until you hit the send button."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,68,"Furthermore, once you send the message, there is no stopping it."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,69,"Because it is all or none, the  action potential  is recreated, or propagated, at its full strength at every point along the axon."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,70,"Much like the lit fuse of a firecracker, it does not fade away as it travels down the axon."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,71,It is this all-or-none property that explains the fact that your brain perceives an injury to a distant body part like your toe as equally painful as one to your nose.
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,72,"As noted earlier, when the action potential arrives at the terminal button, the synaptic vesicles release their neurotransmitters into the synapse."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,73,"The neurotransmitters travel across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites of the adjacent neuron, and the process repeats itself in the new neuron (assuming the signal is sufficiently strong to trigger an action potential)."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,74,"Once the signal is delivered, excess neurotransmitters in the synapse drift away, are broken down into inactive fragments, or are reabsorbed in a process known as  reuptake ."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,75,"Reuptake involves the neurotransmitter being pumped back into the neuron that released it, in order to clear the synapse ( Figure 3.12 )."
48edae7e-72a6-417b-a426-4353a717d577@12,3,3,Cells of the Nervous System,76,"Clearing the synapse serves both to provide a clear ""on"" and ""off"" state between signals and to regulate the production of neurotransmitter (full synaptic vesicles provide signals that no additional neurotransmitters need to be produced)."

fb1b3b55-ef15-44f3-9d52-df597ba53b4d@11,3,4,Parts of the Nervous System,29,"Recent research suggests that an increase in susceptibility to heart disease (Chandola, Brunner, &amp; Marmot, 2006) and impaired function of the immune system (Glaser &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005) are among the many negative consequences of persistent and repeated exposure to stressful situations."
fb1b3b55-ef15-44f3-9d52-df597ba53b4d@11,3,4,Parts of the Nervous System,30,"Once the threat has been resolved, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over and returns bodily functions to a relaxed state."

fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,2,"It is a bilateral, or two-sided, structure that can be separated into distinct lobes."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,3,"Each lobe is associated with certain types of functions, but, ultimately, all of the areas of the brain interact with one another to provide the foundation for our thoughts and behaviors."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,4,"In this section, we discuss the overall organization of the brain and the functions associated with different brain areas, beginning with what can be seen as an extension of the brain, the spinal cord."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,5,The Spinal Cord  It can be said that the  spinal cord  is what connects the brain to the outside world.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,6,"Because of it, the brain can act."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,7,"The spinal cord is like a relay station, but a very smart one."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,8,"It not only routes messages to and from the brain, but it also has its own system of automatic processes, called reflexes."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,9,"The top of the spinal cord merges with the brain stem, where the basic processes of life are controlled, such as breathing and digestion."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,10,"In the opposite direction, the spinal cord ends just below the ribs—contrary to what we might expect, it does not extend all the way to the base of the spine."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,11,"The spinal cord is functionally organized in 30 segments, corresponding with the vertebrae."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,12,Each segment is connected to a specific part of the body through the peripheral nervous system.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,13,Nerves branch out from the spine at each vertebra.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,14,Sensory nerves bring messages in; motor nerves send messages out to the muscles and organs.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,15,Messages travel to and from the brain through every segment.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,16,"Some sensory messages are immediately acted on by the spinal cord, without any input from the brain."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,17,Withdrawal from heat and knee jerk are two examples.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,18,"When a sensory message meets certain parameters, the spinal cord initiates an automatic reflex."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,19,"The signal passes from the sensory nerve to a simple processing center, which initiates a motor command."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,20,"Seconds are saved, because messages don't have to go the brain, be processed, and get sent back."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,21,"In matters of survival, the spinal reflexes allow the body to react extraordinarily fast."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,22,"The spinal cord is protected by bony vertebrae and cushioned in cerebrospinal fluid, but injuries still occur."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,23,"When the spinal cord is damaged in a particular segment, all lower segments are cut off from the brain, causing paralysis."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,24,"Therefore, the lower on the spine damage is, the fewer functions an injured individual loses."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,25,"The Two Hemispheres  The surface of the brain, known as the  cerebral cortex , is very uneven, characterized by a distinctive pattern of folds or bumps, known as  gyri  (singular: gyrus), and grooves, known as  sulci  (singular: sulcus), shown in  Figure 3.15 ."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,26,These gyri and sulci form important landmarks that allow us to separate the brain into functional centers.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,27,"The most prominent sulcus, known as the  longitudinal fissure , is the deep groove that separates the brain into two halves or  hemispheres : the left hemisphere and the right hemisphere."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,28,Figure   3.15        The surface of the brain is covered with gyri and sulci.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,29,"A deep sulcus is called a fissure, such as the longitudinal fissure that divides the brain into left and right hemispheres."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,30,"There is evidence of some specialization of function—referred to as  lateralization —in each hemisphere, mainly regarding differences in language ability."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,31,"Beyond that, however, the differences that have been found have been minor."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,32,"What we do know is that the left hemisphere controls the right half of the body, and the right hemisphere controls the left half of the body."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,33,"The two hemispheres are connected by a thick band of neural fibers known as the  corpus callosum , consisting of about 200 million axons."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,34,The corpus callosum allows the two hemispheres to communicate with each other and allows for information being processed on one side of the brain to be shared with the other side.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,35,"Normally, we are not aware of the different roles that our two hemispheres play in day-to-day functions, but there are people who come to know the capabilities and functions of their two hemispheres quite well."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,36,"In some cases of severe epilepsy, doctors elect to sever the corpus callosum as a means of controlling the spread of seizures ( Figure 3.16 )."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,37,"While this is an effective treatment option, it results in individuals who have split brains."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,38,"After surgery, these split-brain patients show a variety of interesting behaviors."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,39,"For instance, a split-brain patient is unable to name a picture that is shown in the patient's left visual field because the information is only available in the largely nonverbal right hemisphere."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,40,"However, they are able to recreate the picture with their left hand, which is also controlled by the right hemisphere."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,41,"When the more verbal left hemisphere sees the picture that the hand drew, the patient is able to name it (assuming the left hemisphere can interpret what was drawn by the left hand)."

fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,45,Much of what we know about the functions of different areas of the brain comes from studying changes in the behavior and ability of individuals who have suffered damage to the brain.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,46,"For example, researchers study the behavioral changes caused by strokes to learn about the functions of specific brain areas."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,47,"A stroke, caused by an interruption of blood flow to a region in the brain, causes a loss of brain function in the affected region."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,48,"The damage can be in a small area, and, if it is, this gives researchers the opportunity to link any resulting behavioral changes to a specific area."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,49,The types of deficits displayed after a stroke will be largely dependent on where in the brain the damage occurred.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,50,"Consider Theona, an intelligent, self-sufficient woman, who is 62 years old."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,51,"Recently, she suffered a stroke in the front portion of her right hemisphere."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,52,"As a result, she has great difficulty moving her left leg."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,53,"As you learned earlier, the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body; also, the brain's main motor centers are located at the front of the head, in the frontal lobe.)"
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,54,Theona has also experienced behavioral changes.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,55,"For example, while in the produce section of the grocery store, she sometimes eats grapes, strawberries, and apples directly from their bins before paying for them."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,56,"This behavior—which would have been very embarrassing to her before the stroke—is consistent with damage in another region in the frontal lobe—the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with judgment, reasoning, and impulse control."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,57,"Forebrain Structures  The two hemispheres of the cerebral cortex are part of the  forebrain  ( Figure 3.17 ), which is the largest part of the brain."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,58,"The forebrain contains the cerebral cortex and a number of other structures that lie beneath the cortex (called subcortical structures): thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and the limbic system (collection of structures)."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,59,"The cerebral cortex, which is the outer surface of the brain, is associated with higher level processes such as consciousness, thought, emotion, reasoning, language, and memory."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,60,"Each cerebral hemisphere can be subdivided into four lobes, each associated with different functions."

fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,62,"Lobes of the Brain  The four lobes of the brain are the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes ( Figure 3.18 )."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,63,"The  frontal lobe  is located in the forward part of the brain, extending back to a fissure known as the central sulcus."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,64,"The frontal lobe is involved in reasoning, motor control, emotion, and language."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,65,"It contains the  motor cortex , which is involved in planning and coordinating movement; the  prefrontal cortex , which is responsible for higher-level cognitive functioning; and  Broca's area , which is essential for language production."

fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,67,People who suffer damage to Broca's area have great difficulty producing language of any form ( Figure 3.18 ).
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,68,"For example, Padma was an electrical engineer who was socially active and a caring, involved mother."

fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,70,She completely lost the ability to speak and form any kind of meaningful language.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,71,"There is nothing wrong with her mouth or her vocal cords, but she is unable to produce words."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,72,"She can follow directions but can't respond verbally, and she can read but no longer write."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,73,"She can do routine tasks like running to the market to buy milk, but she could not communicate verbally if a situation called for it."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,74,Probably the most famous case of frontal lobe damage is that of a man by the name of Phineas  Gage .
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,75,"On September 13, 1848, Gage (age 25) was working as a railroad foreman in Vermont."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,76,He and his crew were using an iron rod to tamp explosives down into a blasting hole to remove rock along the railway's path.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,77,"Unfortunately, the iron rod created a spark and caused the rod to explode out of the blasting hole, into Gage's face, and through his skull ( Figure 3.19 )."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,78,"Although lying in a pool of his own blood with brain matter emerging from his head, Gage was conscious and able to get up, walk, and speak."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,79,"But in the months following his accident, people noticed that his personality had changed."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,80,Many of his friends described him as no longer being himself.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,81,"Before the accident, it was said that Gage was a well-mannered, soft-spoken man, but he began to behave in odd and inappropriate ways after the accident."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,82,Such changes in personality would be consistent with loss of impulse control—a frontal lobe function.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,83,"Beyond the damage to the frontal lobe itself, subsequent investigations into the rod's path also identified probable damage to pathways between the frontal lobe and other brain structures, including the limbic system."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,84,"With connections between the planning functions of the frontal lobe and the emotional processes of the limbic system severed, Gage had difficulty controlling his emotional impulses."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,85,"However, there is some evidence suggesting that the dramatic changes in Gage's personality were exaggerated and embellished."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,86,Gage's case occurred in the midst of a 19 th  century debate over localization—regarding whether certain areas of the brain are associated with particular functions.
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,87,"On the basis of extremely limited information about Gage, the extent of his injury, and his life before and after the accident, scientists tended to find support for their own views, on whichever side of the debate they fell (Macmillan, 1999)."

fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,91,"The brain's  parietal lobe  is located immediately behind the frontal lobe, and is involved in processing information from the body's senses."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,92,"It contains the  somatosensory cortex , which is essential for processing sensory information from across the body, such as touch, temperature, and pain."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,93,"The somatosensory cortex is organized topographically, which means that spatial relationships that exist in the body are maintained on the surface of the somatosensory cortex ( Figure 3.20 )."
fc8a38cc-fd1c-44cc-b91d-726fcfa62165@12,3,5,The Brain and Spinal Cord,94,"For example, the portion of the cortex that processes sensory information from the hand is adjacent to the portion that processes information from the wrist."

df8a0598-0c65-4379-89ce-928ec2ed293f@13,3,6,The Endocrine System,2,"Like neurotransmitters, hormones are chemical messengers that must bind to a receptor in order to send their signal."
df8a0598-0c65-4379-89ce-928ec2ed293f@13,3,6,The Endocrine System,3,"However, unlike neurotransmitters, which are released in close proximity to cells with their receptors, hormones are secreted into the bloodstream and travel throughout the body, affecting any cells that contain receptors for them."
df8a0598-0c65-4379-89ce-928ec2ed293f@13,3,6,The Endocrine System,4,"Thus, whereas neurotransmitters' effects are localized, the effects of hormones are widespread."

b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,3,"Awareness of internal stimuli includes feeling pain, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, and being aware of our thoughts and emotions."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,4,"Awareness of external stimuli includes seeing the light from the sun, feeling the warmth of a room, and hearing the voice of a friend."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,5,We experience different states of consciousness and different levels of awareness on a regular basis.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,6,We might even describe consciousness as a continuum that ranges from full awareness to a deep sleep.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,7,Sleep  is a state marked by relatively low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness that is distinct from periods of rest that occur during wakefulness.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,8,"Wakefulness  is characterized by high levels of sensory awareness, thought, and behavior."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,9,"In between these extremes are states of consciousness related to daydreaming, intoxication as a result of alcohol or other drug use, meditative states, hypnotic states, and altered states of consciousness following sleep deprivation."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,10,We might also experience unconscious states of being via drug-induced anesthesia for medical purposes.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,11,"Often, we are not completely aware of our surroundings, even when we are fully awake."

b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,14,"Many of these processes, like much of psychological behavior, are rooted in our biology."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,15,Biological Rhythms        Biological rhythms  are internal rhythms of biological activity.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,16,"A woman's menstrual cycle is an example of a biological rhythm—a recurring, cyclical pattern of bodily changes."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,17,One complete menstrual cycle takes about 28 days—a lunar month—but many biological cycles are much shorter.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,18,"For example, body temperature fluctuates cyclically over a 24-hour period ( Figure 4.2 )."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,19,"Alertness is associated with higher body temperatures, and sleepiness with lower body temperatures."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,20,Figure   4.2        This chart illustrates the circadian change in body temperature over 28 hours in a group of eight young men.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,21,"Body temperature rises throughout the waking day, peaking in the afternoon, and falls during sleep with the lowest point occurring during the very early morning hours."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,22,"This pattern of temperature fluctuation, which repeats every day, is one example of a circadian rhythm."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,23,A  circadian rhythm  is a biological rhythm that takes place over a period of about 24 hours.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,24,"Our sleep-wake cycle, which is linked to our environment's natural light-dark cycle, is perhaps the most obvious example of a circadian rhythm, but we also have daily fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure, blood sugar, and body temperature."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,25,Some circadian rhythms play a role in changes in our state of consciousness.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,26,"If we have biological rhythms, then is there some sort of  biological clock ?"
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,27,"In the brain, the hypothalamus, which lies above the pituitary gland, is a main center of homeostasis."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,28,"Homeostasis  is the tendency to maintain a balance, or optimal level, within a biological system."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,29,The brain's clock mechanism is located in an area of the hypothalamus known as the  suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) .
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,30,"The axons of light-sensitive neurons in the retina provide information to the SCN based on the amount of light present, allowing this internal clock to be synchronized with the outside world (Klein, Moore, &amp; Reppert, 1991; Welsh, Takahashi, &amp; Kay, 2010) ( Figure 4.3 )."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,31,Figure   4.3        The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) serves as the brain's clock mechanism.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,32,The clock sets itself with light information received through projections from the retina.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,33,"Problems With Circadian Rhythms       Generally, and for most people, our circadian cycles are aligned with the outside world."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,34,"For example, most people sleep during the night and are awake during the day."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,35,One important regulator of sleep-wake cycles is the hormone  melatonin .
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,36,"The  pineal gland , an endocrine structure located inside the brain that releases melatonin, is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and of the immune system during sleep (Hardeland, Pandi-Perumal, &amp; Cardinali, 2006)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,37,Melatonin release is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,38,There are individual differences with regards to our sleep-wake cycle.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,39,"For instance, some people would say they are morning people, while others would consider themselves to be night owls."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,40,"These individual differences in circadian patterns of activity are known as a person's chronotype, and research demonstrates that morning larks and night owls differ with regard to sleep regulation (Taillard, Philip, Coste, Sagaspe, &amp; Bioulac, 2003)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,41,Sleep regulation  refers to the brain's control of switching between sleep and wakefulness as well as coordinating this cycle with the outside world.

b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,44,One way that this happens involves traveling across multiple time zones.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,45,"When we do this, we often experience jet lag."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,46,Jet lag  is a collection of symptoms that results from the mismatch between our internal circadian cycles and our environment.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,47,"These symptoms include fatigue, sluggishness, irritability, and  insomnia  (i.e., a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep for at least three nights a week over a month's time) (Roth, 2007)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,48,Individuals who do rotating shift work are also likely to experience disruptions in circadian cycles.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,49,Rotating shift work  refers to a work schedule that changes from early to late on a daily or weekly basis.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,50,"For example, a person may work from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Monday, 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, and 11:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. on Wednesday."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,51,"In such instances, the individual's schedule changes so frequently that it becomes difficult for a normal circadian rhythm to be maintained."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,52,"This often results in sleeping problems, and it can lead to signs of depression and anxiety."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,53,"These kinds of schedules are common for individuals working in health care professions and service industries, and they are associated with persistent feelings of exhaustion and agitation that can make someone more prone to making mistakes on the job (Gold et al., 1992; Presser, 1995)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,54,"Rotating shift work has pervasive effects on the lives and experiences of individuals engaged in that kind of work, which is clearly illustrated in stories reported in a qualitative study that researched the experiences of middle-aged nurses who worked rotating shifts (West, Boughton &amp; Byrnes, 2009)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,55,Several of the nurses interviewed commented that their work schedules affected their relationships with their family.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,56,"One of the nurses said,           If you've had a partner who does work regular job 9 to 5 office hours ."

b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,58,that would be one of the problems that I've encountered.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,59,"West et al., 2009, p. 114)          While disruptions in circadian rhythms can have negative consequences, there are things we can do to help us realign our biological clocks with the external environment."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,60,"Some of these approaches, such as using a bright light as shown in  Figure 4.4 , have been shown to alleviate some of the problems experienced by individuals suffering from jet lag or from the consequences of rotating shift work."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,61,"Because the biological clock is driven by light, exposure to bright light during working shifts and dark exposure when not working can help combat insomnia and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Huang, Tsai, Chen, &amp; Hsu, 2013)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,62,Figure   4.4        Devices like this are designed to provide exposure to bright light to help people maintain a regular circadian cycle.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,63,They can be helpful for people working night shifts or for people affected by seasonal variations in light.

b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,65,"Insufficient Sleep         When people have difficulty getting sleep due to their work or the demands of day-to-day life, they accumulate a sleep debt."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,66,A person with a  sleep debt  does not get sufficient sleep on a chronic basis.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,67,The consequences of sleep debt include decreased levels of alertness and mental efficiency.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,68,"Interestingly, since the advent of electric light, the amount of sleep that people get has declined."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,69,"While we certainly welcome the convenience of having the darkness lit up, we also suffer the consequences of reduced amounts of sleep because we are more active during the nighttime hours than our ancestors were."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,70,"As a result, many of us sleep less than 7–8 hours a night and accrue a sleep debt."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,71,"While there is tremendous variation in any given individual's sleep needs, the National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) cites research to estimate that newborns require the most sleep (between 12 and 18 hours a night) and that this amount declines to just 7–9 hours by the time we are adults."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,72,"If you lie down to take a nap and fall asleep very easily, chances are you may have sleep debt."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,73,"Given that college students are notorious for suffering from significant sleep debt (Hicks, Fernandez, &amp; Pelligrini, 2001; Hicks, Johnson, &amp; Pelligrini, 1992; Miller, Shattuck, &amp; Matsangas, 2010), chances are you and your classmates deal with sleep debt-related issues on a regular basis."

b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,77,"As mentioned earlier, lack of sleep can result in decreased mental alertness and cognitive function."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,78,"In addition, sleep deprivation often results in depression-like symptoms."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,79,These effects can occur as a function of accumulated sleep debt or in response to more acute periods of sleep deprivation.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,80,"It may surprise you to know that sleep deprivation is associated with obesity, increased blood pressure, increased levels of stress hormones, and reduced immune functioning (Banks &amp; Dinges, 2007)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,81,A sleep deprived individual generally will fall asleep more quickly than if she were not sleep deprived.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,82,Some sleep-deprived individuals have difficulty staying awake when they stop moving (example sitting and watching television or driving a car).
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,83,That is why individuals suffering from sleep deprivation can also put themselves and others at risk when they put themselves behind the wheel of a car or work with dangerous machinery.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,84,"Some research suggests that sleep deprivation affects cognitive and motor function as much as, if not more than, alcohol intoxication (Williamson &amp; Feyer, 2000)."

b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,88,The amount of sleep we get varies across the lifespan.
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,89,"When we are very young, we spend up to 16 hours a day sleeping."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,90,"As we grow older, we sleep less."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,91,"In fact, a  meta-analysis , which is a study that combines the results of many related studies, conducted within the last decade indicates that by the time we are 65 years old, we average fewer than 7 hours of sleep per day (Ohayon, Carskadon, Guilleminault, &amp; Vitiello, 2004)."
b5e7f2ec-4e9c-467d-82cc-e0a5f8a35487@15,4,2,,92,"As the amount of time we sleep varies over our lifespan, presumably the sleep debt would adjust accordingly."

1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,4,Why do we devote so much time to sleeping?
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,5,Is it absolutely essential that we sleep?
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,6,This section will consider these questions and explore various explanations for why we sleep.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,7,What is Sleep?
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,8,You have read that sleep is distinguished by low levels of physical activity and reduced sensory awareness.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,9,"As discussed by Siegel (2008), a definition of sleep must also include mention of the interplay of the circadian and homeostatic mechanisms that regulate sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,10,Homeostatic regulation of sleep is evidenced by sleep rebound following sleep deprivation.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,11,Sleep rebound  refers to the fact that a sleep-deprived individual will tend to take a shorter time to fall asleep during subsequent opportunities for sleep.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,12,"Sleep is characterized by certain patterns of activity of the brain that can be visualized using electroencephalography (EEG), and different phases of sleep can be differentiated using EEG as well ( Figure 4.6 )."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,13,"Figure   4.6        This is a segment of a polysonograph (PSG), a recording of several physical variables during sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,14,The  x -axis shows passage of time in seconds; this record includes 30 seconds of data.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,15,The location of the sets of electrode that produced each signal is labeled on the  y -axis.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,16,"The red box encompasses EEG output, and the waveforms are characteristic of a specific stage of sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,17,"Other curves show other sleep-related data, such as body temperature, muscle activity, and heartbeat."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,18,Sleep-wake cycles seem to be controlled by multiple brain areas acting in conjunction with one another.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,19,"Some of these areas include the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the pons."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,20,"As already mentioned, the hypothalamus contains the SCN—the biological clock of the body—in addition to other nuclei that, in conjunction with the thalamus, regulate slow-wave sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,21,"The pons is important for regulating rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (National Institutes of Health, n.d.)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,22,"Sleep is also associated with the secretion and regulation of a number of hormones from several endocrine glands including: melatonin, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and growth hormone (National Institutes of Health, n.d.)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,23,You have read that the pineal gland releases melatonin during sleep ( Figure 4.7 ).
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,24,"Melatonin is thought to be involved in the regulation of various biological rhythms and the immune system (Hardeland et al., 2006)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,25,"During sleep, the pituitary gland secretes both FSH and LH which are important in regulating the reproductive system (Christensen et al., 2012; Sofikitis et al., 2008)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,26,"The pituitary gland also secretes growth hormone, during sleep, which plays a role in physical growth and maturation as well as other metabolic processes (Bartke, Sun, &amp; Longo, 2013)."

1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,28,Why Do We Sleep?
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,29,"Given the central role that sleep plays in our lives and the number of adverse consequences that have been associated with sleep deprivation, one would think that we would have a clear understanding of why it is that we sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,30,"Unfortunately, this is not the case; however, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the function of sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,31,Adaptive Function of Sleep         One popular hypothesis of sleep incorporates the perspective of evolutionary psychology.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,32,Evolutionary psychology  is a discipline that studies how universal patterns of behavior and cognitive processes have evolved over time as a result of  natural selection .
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,33,Variations and adaptations in cognition and behavior make individuals more or less successful in reproducing and passing their genes to their offspring.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,34,One hypothesis from this perspective might argue that sleep is essential to restore resources that are expended during the day.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,35,"Just as bears hibernate in the winter when resources are scarce, perhaps people sleep at night to reduce their energy expenditures."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,36,"While this is an intuitive explanation of sleep, there is little research that supports this explanation."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,37,"In fact, it has been suggested that there is no reason to think that energetic demands could not be addressed with periods of rest and inactivity (Frank, 2006; Rial et al., 2007), and some research has actually found a negative correlation between energetic demands and the amount of time spent sleeping (Capellini, Barton, McNamara, Preston, &amp; Nunn, 2008)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,38,"Another evolutionary hypothesis of sleep holds that our sleep patterns evolved as an adaptive response to predatory risks, which increase in darkness."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,39,Thus we sleep in safe areas to reduce the chance of harm.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,40,"Again, this is an intuitive and appealing explanation for why we sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,41,Perhaps our ancestors spent extended periods of time asleep to reduce attention to themselves from potential predators.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,42,"Comparative research indicates, however, that the relationship that exists between predatory risk and sleep is very complex and equivocal."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,43,"Some research suggests that species that face higher predatory risks sleep fewer hours than other species (Capellini et al., 2008), while other researchers suggest there is no relationship between the amount of time a given species spends in deep sleep and its predation risk (Lesku, Roth, Amlaner, &amp; Lima, 2006)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,44,"It is quite possible that sleep serves no single universally adaptive function, and different species have evolved different patterns of sleep in response to their unique evolutionary pressures."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,45,"While we have discussed the negative outcomes associated with sleep deprivation, it should be pointed out that there are many benefits that are associated with adequate amounts of sleep."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,46,"A few such benefits listed by the National Sleep Foundation (n.d.) include maintaining healthy weight, lowering stress levels, improving mood, and increasing motor coordination, as well as a number of benefits related to cognition and memory formation."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,47,"Cognitive Function of Sleep           Another theory regarding why we sleep involves sleep's importance for cognitive function and memory formation (Rattenborg, Lesku, Martinez-Gonzalez, &amp; Lima, 2007)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,48,"Indeed, we know sleep deprivation results in disruptions in cognition and memory deficits (Brown, 2012), leading to impairments in our abilities to maintain attention, make decisions, and recall long-term memories."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,49,"Moreover, these impairments become more severe as the amount of sleep deprivation increases (Alhola &amp; Polo-Kantola, 2007)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,50,"Furthermore, slow-wave sleep after learning a new task can improve resultant performance on that task (Huber, Ghilardi, Massimini, &amp; Tononi, 2004) and seems essential for effective memory formation (Stickgold, 2005)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,51,Understanding the impact of sleep on cognitive function should help you understand that cramming all night for a test may be not effective and can even prove counterproductive.

1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,54,Sleep has also been associated with other cognitive benefits.
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,55,"Research indicates that included among these possible benefits are increased capacities for creative thinking (Cai, Mednick, Harrison, Kanady, &amp; Mednick, 2009; Wagner, Gais, Haider, Verleger, &amp; Born, 2004), language learning (Fenn, Nusbaum, &amp; Margoliash, 2003; Gómez, Bootzin, &amp; Nadel, 2006), and inferential judgments (Ellenbogen, Hu, Payne, Titone, &amp; Walker, 2007)."
1c14e4d3-a6df-4481-be4f-4395914859ab@13,4,3,Sleep and Why We Sleep,56,"It is possible that even the processing of emotional information is influenced by certain aspects of sleep (Walker, 2009)."

1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,2,"Instead, sleep is composed of several different stages that can be differentiated from one another by the patterns of brain wave activity that occur during each stage."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,3,These changes in brain wave activity can be visualized using EEG and are distinguished from one another by both the frequency and amplitude of brain waves ( Figure 4.8 ).
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,4,Sleep can be divided into two different general phases: REM sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,5,Rapid eye movement (REM)  sleep is characterized by darting movements of the eyes under closed eyelids.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,6,Brain waves during REM sleep appear very similar to brain waves during wakefulness.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,7,"In contrast,  non-REM (NREM)  sleep is subdivided into four stages distinguished from each other and from wakefulness by characteristic patterns of brain waves."

1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,11,NREM Stages of Sleep       The first stage of NREM sleep is known as stage 1 sleep.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,12,"Stage 1 sleep  is a transitional phase that occurs between wakefulness and sleep, the period during which we drift off to sleep."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,13,"During this time, there is a slowdown in both the rates of respiration and heartbeat."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,14,"In addition, stage 1 sleep involves a marked decrease in both overall muscle tension and core body temperature."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,15,"In terms of brain wave activity, stage 1 sleep is associated with both alpha and theta waves."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,16,"The early portion of stage 1 sleep produces  alpha waves , which are relatively low frequency (8–13Hz), high amplitude patterns of electrical activity (waves) that become synchronized ( Figure 4.9 )."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,17,"This pattern of brain wave activity resembles that of someone who is very relaxed, yet awake."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,18,"As an individual continues through stage 1 sleep, there is an increase in theta wave activity."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,19,"Theta waves  are even lower frequency (4–7 Hz), higher amplitude brain waves than alpha waves."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,20,"It is relatively easy to wake someone from stage 1 sleep; in fact, people often report that they have not been asleep if they are awoken during stage 1 sleep."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,21,Figure   4.9        Brainwave activity changes dramatically across the different stages of sleep.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,22,"As we move into  stage 2 sleep , the body goes into a state of deep relaxation."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,23,"Theta waves still dominate the activity of the brain, but they are interrupted by brief bursts of activity known as sleep spindles ( Figure 4.10 )."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,24,"A  sleep spindle  is a rapid burst of higher frequency brain waves that may be important for learning and memory (Fogel &amp; Smith, 2011; Poe, Walsh, &amp; Bjorness, 2010)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,25,"In addition, the appearance of K-complexes is often associated with stage 2 sleep."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,26,A  K-complex  is a very high amplitude pattern of brain activity that may in some cases occur in response to environmental stimuli.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,27,"Thus, K-complexes might serve as a bridge to higher levels of arousal in response to what is going on in our environments (Halász, 1993; Steriade &amp; Amzica, 1998)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,28,Figure   4.10        Stage 2 sleep is characterized by the appearance of both sleep spindles and K-complexes.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,29,"Stage 3  and  stage 4  of sleep are often referred to as deep sleep or slow-wave sleep because these stages are characterized by low frequency (up to 4 Hz), high amplitude  delta waves  ( Figure 4.11 )."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,30,"During this time, an individual's heart rate and respiration slow dramatically."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,31,It is much more difficult to awaken someone from sleep during stage 3 and stage 4 than during earlier stages.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,32,"Interestingly, individuals who have increased levels of alpha brain wave activity (more often associated with wakefulness and transition into stage 1 sleep) during stage 3 and stage 4 often report that they do not feel refreshed upon waking, regardless of how long they slept (Stone, Taylor, McCrae, Kalsekar, &amp; Lichstein, 2008)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,33,"Figure   4.11        (a) Delta waves, which are low frequency and high amplitude, characterize (b) slow-wave stage 3 and stage 4 sleep."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,34,"REM Sleep       As mentioned earlier, REM sleep is marked by rapid movements of the eyes."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,35,"The brain waves associated with this stage of sleep are very similar to those observed when a person is awake, as shown in  Figure 4.12 , and this is the period of sleep in which dreaming occurs."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,36,It is also associated with paralysis of muscle systems in the body with the exception of those that make circulation and respiration possible.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,37,"Therefore, no movement of voluntary muscles occurs during REM sleep in a normal individual; REM sleep is often referred to as paradoxical sleep because of this combination of high brain activity and lack of muscle tone."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,38,"Like NREM sleep, REM has been implicated in various aspects of learning and memory (Wagner, Gais, &amp; Born, 2001), although there is disagreement within the scientific community about how important both NREM and REM sleep are for normal learning and memory (Siegel, 2001)."

1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,41,"If people are deprived of REM sleep and then allowed to sleep without disturbance, they will spend more time in REM sleep in what would appear to be an effort to recoup the lost time in REM."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,42,"This is known as the REM rebound, and it suggests that REM sleep is also homeostatically regulated."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,43,"Aside from the role that REM sleep may play in processes related to learning and memory, REM sleep may also be involved in emotional processing and regulation."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,44,"In such instances, REM rebound may actually represent an adaptive response to stress in nondepressed individuals by suppressing the emotional salience of aversive events that occurred in wakefulness (Suchecki, Tiba, &amp; Machado, 2012)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,45,"While sleep deprivation in general is associated with a number of negative consequences (Brown, 2012), the consequences of REM deprivation appear to be less profound (as discussed in Siegel, 2001)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,46,"In fact, some have suggested that REM deprivation can actually be beneficial in some circumstances."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,47,"For instance, REM sleep deprivation has been demonstrated to improve symptoms of people suffering from major depression, and many effective antidepressant medications suppress REM sleep (Riemann, Berger, &amp; Volderholzer, 2001; Vogel, 1975)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,48,"It should be pointed out that some reviews of the literature challenge this finding, suggesting that sleep deprivation that is not limited to REM sleep is just as effective or more effective at alleviating depressive symptoms among some patients suffering from depression."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,49,"In either case, why sleep deprivation improves the mood of some patients is not entirely understood (Giedke &amp; Schwärzler, 2002)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,50,"Recently, however, some have suggested that sleep deprivation might change emotional processing so that various stimuli are more likely to be perceived as positive in nature (Gujar, Yoo, Hu, &amp; Walker, 2011)."

1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,55,Dreams          The meaning of dreams varies across different cultures and periods of time.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,56,"By the late 19th century, German psychiatrist Sigmund  Freud  had become convinced that dreams represented an opportunity to gain access to the unconscious."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,57,"By analyzing dreams, Freud thought people could increase self-awareness and gain valuable insight to help them deal with the problems they faced in their lives."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,58,Freud made distinctions between the manifest content and the latent content of dreams.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,59,"Manifest content  is the actual content, or storyline, of a dream."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,60,"Latent content , on the other hand, refers to the hidden meaning of a dream."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,61,"For instance, if a woman dreams about being chased by a snake, Freud might have argued that this represents the woman's fear of sexual intimacy, with the snake serving as a symbol of a man's penis."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,62,Freud was not the only theorist to focus on the content of dreams.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,63,The 20th century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung believed that dreams allowed us to tap into the collective unconscious.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,64,"The  collective unconscious , as described by  Jung , is a theoretical repository of information he believed to be shared by everyone."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,65,"According to Jung, certain symbols in dreams reflected universal archetypes with meanings that are similar for all people regardless of culture or location."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,66,"The sleep and dreaming researcher Rosalind Cartwright, however, believes that dreams simply reflect life events that are important to the dreamer."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,67,"Unlike Freud and Jung, Cartwright's ideas about dreaming have found empirical support."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,68,"For example, she and her colleagues published a study in which women going through divorce were asked several times over a five month period to report the degree to which their former spouses were on their minds."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,69,These same women were awakened during REM sleep in order to provide a detailed account of their dream content.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,70,"There was a significant positive correlation between the degree to which women thought about their former spouses during waking hours and the number of times their former spouses appeared as characters in their dreams (Cartwright, Agargun, Kirkby, &amp; Friedman, 2006)."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,71,"Recent research (Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, &amp; Kamitani, 2013) has uncovered new techniques by which researchers may effectively detect and classify the visual images that occur during dreaming by using fMRI for neural measurement of brain activity patterns, opening the way for additional research in this area."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,72,"Recently, neuroscientists have also become interested in understanding why we dream."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,73,"For example, Hobson (2009) suggests that dreaming may represent a state of protoconsciousness."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,74,"In other words, dreaming involves constructing a virtual reality in our heads that we might use to help us during wakefulness."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,75,"Among a variety of neurobiological evidence, John Hobson cites research on lucid dreams as an opportunity to better understand dreaming in general."
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,76,Lucid dreams  are dreams in which certain aspects of wakefulness are maintained during a dream state.
1b88b415-8df3-4b05-9bfa-3b914124d54e@14,4,4,Stages of Sleep,77,"In a lucid dream, a person becomes aware of the fact that they are dreaming, and as such, they can control the dream's content (LaBerge, 1990)."

32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,4,"Insomnia       Insomnia, a consistent difficulty in falling or staying asleep, is the most common of the sleep disorders."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,5,Individuals with insomnia often experience long delays between the times that they go to bed and actually fall asleep.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,6,"In addition, these individuals may wake up several times during the night only to find that they have difficulty getting back to sleep."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,7,"As mentioned earlier, one of the criteria for insomnia involves experiencing these symptoms for at least three nights a week for at least one month's time (Roth, 2007)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,8,It is not uncommon for people suffering from insomnia to experience increased levels of anxiety about their inability to fall asleep.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,9,"This becomes a self-perpetuating cycle because increased anxiety leads to increased arousal, and higher levels of arousal make the prospect of falling asleep even more unlikely."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,10,Chronic insomnia is almost always associated with feeling overtired and may be associated with symptoms of depression.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,11,"There may be many factors that contribute to insomnia, including age, drug use, exercise, mental status, and bedtime routines."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,12,"Not surprisingly, insomnia treatment may take one of several different approaches."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,13,People who suffer from insomnia might limit their use of stimulant drugs (such as caffeine) or increase their amount of physical exercise during the day.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,14,"Some people might turn to over-the-counter (OTC) or prescribed sleep medications to help them sleep, but this should be done sparingly because many sleep medications result in dependence and alter the nature of the sleep cycle, and they can increase insomnia over time."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,15,"Those who continue to have insomnia, particularly if it affects their quality of life, should seek professional treatment."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,16,"Some forms of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, can help sufferers of insomnia."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,17,Cognitive-behavioral therapy  is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on cognitive processes and problem behaviors.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,18,"The treatment of insomnia likely would include stress management techniques and changes in problematic behaviors that could contribute to insomnia (e.g., spending more waking time in bed)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,19,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy has been demonstrated to be quite effective in treating insomnia (Savard, Simard, Ivers, &amp; Morin, 2005; Williams, Roth, Vatthauer, &amp; McCrae, 2013)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,20,"Parasomnias       A  parasomnia  is one of a group of sleep disorders in which unwanted, disruptive motor activity and/or experiences during sleep play a role."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,21,Parasomnias can occur in either REM or NREM phases of sleep.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,22,"Sleepwalking, restless leg syndrome, and night terrors are all examples of parasomnias (Mahowald &amp; Schenck, 2000)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,23,"Sleepwalking         In  sleepwalking , or somnambulism, the sleeper engages in relatively complex behaviors ranging from wandering about to driving an automobile."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,24,"During periods of sleepwalking, sleepers often have their eyes open, but they are not responsive to attempts to communicate with them."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,25,"Sleepwalking most often occurs during slow-wave sleep, but it can occur at any time during a sleep period in some affected individuals (Mahowald &amp; Schenck, 2000)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,26,"Historically, somnambulism has been treated with a variety of pharmacotherapies ranging from benzodiazepines to antidepressants."

32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,38,"Upon a search of the premises, police found blood-stained clothes and a bloody knife in the trunk of Falater's car, and he had blood stains on his neck."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,39,"Remarkably, Falater insisted that he had no recollection of hurting his wife in any way."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,40,"His children and his wife's parents all agreed that Falater had an excellent relationship with his wife and they couldn't think of a reason that would provide any sort of motive to murder her (Cartwright, 2004)."

32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,46,REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD)          REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)  occurs when the muscle paralysis associated with the REM sleep phase does not occur.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,47,"Individuals who suffer from RBD have high levels of physical activity during REM sleep, especially during disturbing dreams."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,48,"These behaviors vary widely, but they can include kicking, punching, scratching, yelling, and behaving like an animal that has been frightened or attacked."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,49,People who suffer from this disorder can injure themselves or their sleeping partners when engaging in these behaviors.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,50,"Furthermore, these types of behaviors ultimately disrupt sleep, although affected individuals have no memories that these behaviors have occurred (Arnulf, 2012)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,51,This disorder is associated with a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,52,"In fact, this relationship is so robust that some view the presence of RBD as a potential aid in the diagnosis and treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases (Ferini-Strambi, 2011)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,53,"Clonazepam, an anti-anxiety medication with sedative properties, is most often used to treat RBD."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,54,It is administered alone or in conjunction with doses of melatonin (the hormone secreted by the pineal gland).
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,55,"As part of treatment, the sleeping environment is often modified to make it a safer place for those suffering from RBD (Zangini, Calandra-Buonaura, Grimaldi, &amp; Cortelli, 2011)."

32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,57,"This discomfort is relieved by deliberately moving the legs, which, not surprisingly, contributes to difficulty in falling or staying asleep."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,58,"Restless leg syndrome is quite common and has been associated with a number of other medical diagnoses, such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes (Mahowald &amp; Schenck, 2000)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,59,"There are a variety of drugs that treat restless leg syndrome: benzodiazepines, opiates, and anticonvulsants (Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation, n.d.)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,60,"Night terrors  result in a sense of panic in the sufferer and are often accompanied by screams and attempts to escape from the immediate environment (Mahowald &amp; Schenck, 2000)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,61,"Although individuals suffering from night terrors appear to be awake, they generally have no memories of the events that occurred, and attempts to console them are ineffective."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,62,"Typically, individuals suffering from night terrors will fall back asleep again within a short time."

32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,65,Sleep Apnea     Sleep apnea  is defined by episodes during which a sleeper's breathing stops.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,66,These episodes can last 10–20 seconds or longer and often are associated with brief periods of arousal.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,67,"While individuals suffering from sleep apnea may not be aware of these repeated disruptions in sleep, they do experience increased levels of fatigue."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,68,"Many individuals diagnosed with sleep apnea first seek treatment because their sleeping partners indicate that they snore loudly and/or stop breathing for extended periods of time while sleeping (Henry &amp; Rosenthal, 2013)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,69,Sleep apnea is much more common in overweight people and is often associated with loud snoring.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,70,"Surprisingly, sleep apnea may exacerbate cardiovascular disease (Sánchez-de-la-Torre, Campos-Rodriguez, &amp; Barbé, 2012)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,71,"While sleep apnea is less common in thin people, anyone, regardless of their weight, who snores loudly or gasps for air while sleeping, should be checked for sleep apnea."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,72,"While people are often unaware of their sleep apnea, they are keenly aware of some of the adverse consequences of insufficient sleep."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,73,"Consider a patient who believed that as a result of his sleep apnea he ""had three car accidents in six weeks."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,74,They were ALL my fault.

32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,79,There are two types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,80,"Obstructive sleep apnea  occurs when an individual's airway becomes blocked during sleep, and air is prevented from entering the lungs."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,81,"In  central sleep apnea , disruption in signals sent from the brain that regulate breathing cause periods of interrupted breathing (White, 2005)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,82,One of the most common treatments for sleep apnea involves the use of a special device during sleep.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,83,"A  continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)  device includes a mask that fits over the sleeper's nose and mouth, which is connected to a pump that pumps air into the person's airways, forcing them to remain open, as shown in  Figure 4.14 ."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,84,Some newer CPAP masks are smaller and cover only the nose.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,85,"This treatment option has proven to be effective for people suffering from mild to severe cases of sleep apnea (McDaid et al., 2009)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,86,"However, alternative treatment options are being explored because consistent compliance by users of CPAP devices is a problem."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,87,"Recently, a new EPAP (expiratory positive air pressure) device has shown promise in double-blind trials as one such alternative (Berry, Kryger, &amp; Massie, 2011)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,88,"Figure   4.14        (a) A typical CPAP device used in the treatment of sleep apnea is (b) affixed to the head with straps, and a mask that covers the nose and mouth."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,89,SIDS  In  sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)  an infant stops breathing during sleep and dies.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,90,"Infants younger than 12 months appear to be at the highest risk for SIDS, and boys have a greater risk than girls."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,91,"A number of risk factors have been associated with SIDS including premature birth, smoking within the home, and hyperthermia."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,92,"There may also be differences in both brain structure and function in infants that die from SIDS (Berkowitz, 2012; Mage &amp; Donner, 2006; Thach, 2005)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,93,The substantial amount of research on SIDS has led to a number of recommendations to parents to protect their children ( Figure 4.15 ).
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,94,"For one, research suggests that infants should be placed on their backs when put down to sleep, and their cribs should not contain any items which pose suffocation threats, such as blankets, pillows or padded crib bumpers (cushions that cover the bars of a crib)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,95,"Infants should not have caps placed on their heads when put down to sleep in order to prevent overheating, and people in the child's household should abstain from smoking in the home."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,96,"Recommendations like these have helped to decrease the number of infant deaths from SIDS in recent years (Mitchell, 2009; Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, 2011)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,97,Figure   4.15        The Safe to Sleep campaign educates the public about how to minimize risk factors associated with SIDS.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,98,This campaign is sponsored in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,99,"Narcolepsy        Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section, a person with  narcolepsy  cannot resist falling asleep at inopportune times."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,100,"These sleep episodes are often associated with  cataplexy , which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness, and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,101,"This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep (Burgess &amp; Scammell, 2012; Hishikawa &amp; Shimizu, 1995; Luppi et al., 2011)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,102,Narcoleptic episodes take on other features of REM sleep.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,103,"For example, around one third of individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy experience vivid, dream-like hallucinations during narcoleptic attacks (Chokroverty, 2010)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,104,"Surprisingly, narcoleptic episodes are often triggered by states of heightened arousal or stress."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,105,The typical episode can last from a minute or two to half an hour.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,106,"Once awakened from a narcoleptic attack, people report that they feel refreshed (Chokroverty, 2010)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,107,"Obviously, regular narcoleptic episodes could interfere with the ability to perform one's job or complete schoolwork, and in some situations, narcolepsy can result in significant harm and injury (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery or other potentially dangerous equipment)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,108,"Generally, narcolepsy is treated using psychomotor stimulant drugs, such as amphetamines (Mignot, 2012)."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,109,These drugs promote increased levels of neural activity.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,110,"Narcolepsy is associated with reduced levels of the signaling molecule hypocretin in some areas of the brain (De la Herrán-Arita &amp; Drucker-Colín, 2012; Han, 2012), and the traditional stimulant drugs do not have direct effects on this system."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,111,"Therefore, it is quite likely that new medications that are developed to treat narcolepsy will be designed to target the hypocretin system."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,112,"There is a tremendous amount of variability among sufferers, both in terms of how symptoms of narcolepsy manifest and the effectiveness of currently available treatment options."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,113,This is illustrated by McCarty's (2010) case study of a 50-year-old woman who sought help for the excessive sleepiness during normal waking hours that she had experienced for several years.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,114,"She indicated that she had fallen asleep at inappropriate or dangerous times, including while eating, while socializing with friends, and while driving her car."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,115,"During periods of emotional arousal, the woman complained that she felt some weakness in the right side of her body."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,116,"Although she did not experience any dream-like hallucinations, she was diagnosed with narcolepsy as a result of sleep testing."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,117,"In her case, the fact that her cataplexy was confined to the right side of her body was quite unusual."
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,118,Early attempts to treat her condition with a stimulant drug alone were unsuccessful.
32ad8e27-9a0a-4919-8886-5fbcbb79796e@14,4,5,Sleep Problems and Disorders,119,"However, when a stimulant drug was used in conjunction with a popular antidepressant, her condition improved dramatically."

7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,6,A person who has a substance use disorder often uses more of the substance than they originally intended to and continues to use that substance despite experiencing significant adverse consequences.
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,7,"In individuals diagnosed with a substance use disorder, there is a compulsive pattern of drug use that is often associated with both physical and psychological dependence."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,8,Physical dependence  involves changes in normal bodily functions—the user will experience withdrawal from the drug upon cessation of use.
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,9,"In contrast, a person who has  psychological dependence  has an emotional, rather than physical, need for the drug and may use the drug to relieve psychological distress."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,10,"Tolerance  is linked to physiological dependence, and it occurs when a person requires more and more drug to achieve effects previously experienced at lower doses."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,11,Tolerance can cause the user to increase the amount of drug used to a dangerous level—even to the point of overdose and death.
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,12,Drug  withdrawal  includes a variety of negative symptoms experienced when drug use is discontinued.
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,13,These symptoms usually are opposite of the effects of the drug.
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,14,"For example, withdrawal from sedative drugs often produces unpleasant arousal and agitation."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,15,"In addition to withdrawal, many individuals who are diagnosed with substance use disorders will also develop tolerance to these substances."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,16,"Psychological dependence, or drug craving, is a recent addition to the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder in DSM-5."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,17,This is an important factor because we can develop tolerance and experience withdrawal from any number of drugs that we do not abuse.
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,18,"In other words, physical dependence in and of itself is of limited utility in determining whether or not someone has a substance use disorder."

7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,40,Psychological dependence on these drugs is also possible.
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,41,"Therefore, the abuse potential of central nervous system depressants is relatively high."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,42,"Drug withdrawal is usually an aversive experience, and it can be a life-threatening process in individuals who have a long history of very high doses of alcohol and/or barbiturates."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,43,This is of such concern that people who are trying to overcome addiction to these substances should only do so under medical supervision.

7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,53,"Crack is often less expensive than other forms of cocaine; therefore, it tends to be a more accessible drug for individuals from impoverished segments of society."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,54,"During the 1980s, many drug laws were rewritten to punish crack users more severely than cocaine users."
7ce53544-6c61-4443-9c02-235ca5be5c1c@14,4,6,Substance Use and Abuse,55,"This led to discriminatory sentencing with low-income, inner-city minority populations receiving the harshest punishments."

f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,3,This final section will consider hypnotic and meditative states as additional examples of altered states of consciousness experienced by some individuals.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,4,Hypnosis        Hypnosis  is a state of extreme self-focus and attention in which minimal attention is given to external stimuli.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,5,"In the therapeutic setting, a clinician may use relaxation and suggestion in an attempt to alter the thoughts and perceptions of a patient."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,6,Hypnosis has also been used to draw out information believed to be buried deeply in someone's memory.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,7,"For individuals who are especially open to the power of suggestion, hypnosis can prove to be a very effective technique, and brain imaging studies have demonstrated that hypnotic states are associated with global changes in brain functioning (Del Casale et al., 2012; Guldenmund, Vanhaudenhuyse, Boly, Laureys, &amp; Soddu, 2012)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,8,"Historically, hypnosis has been viewed with some suspicion because of its portrayal in popular media and entertainment ( Figure 4.23 )."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,9,"Therefore, it is important to make a distinction between hypnosis as an empirically based therapeutic approach versus as a form of entertainment."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,10,"Contrary to popular belief, individuals undergoing hypnosis usually have clear memories of the hypnotic experience and are in control of their own behaviors."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,11,"While hypnosis may be useful in enhancing memory or a skill, such enhancements are very modest in nature (Raz, 2011)."

f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,13,How exactly does a hypnotist bring a participant to a state of hypnosis?
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,14,"While there are variations, there are four parts that appear consistent in bringing people into the state of suggestibility associated with hypnosis (National Research Council, 1994)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,15,"These components include:             The participant is guided to focus on one thing, such as the hypnotist's words or a ticking watch."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,16,The participant is made comfortable and is directed to be relaxed and sleepy.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,17,"The participant is told to be open to the process of hypnosis, trust the hypnotist and let go."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,18,The participant is encouraged to use his or her imagination.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,19,These steps are conducive to being open to the heightened suggestibility of hypnosis.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,20,"People vary in terms of their ability to be hypnotized, but a review of available research suggests that most people are at least moderately hypnotizable (Kihlstrom, 2013)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,21,"Hypnosis in conjunction with other techniques is used for a variety of therapeutic purposes and has shown to be at least somewhat effective for pain management, treatment of depression and anxiety, smoking cessation, and weight loss (Alladin, 2012; Elkins, Johnson, &amp; Fisher, 2012; Golden, 2012; Montgomery, Schnur, &amp; Kravits, 2012)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,22,"Some scientists are working to determine whether the power of suggestion can affect cognitive processes such as learning, with a view to using hypnosis in educational settings (Wark, 2011)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,23,"Furthermore, there is some evidence that hypnosis can alter processes that were once thought to be automatic and outside the purview of voluntary control, such as reading (Lifshitz, Aubert Bonn, Fischer, Kashem, &amp; Raz, 2013; Raz, Shapiro, Fan, &amp; Posner, 2002)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,24,"However, it should be noted that others have suggested that the automaticity of these processes remains intact (Augustinova &amp; Ferrand, 2012)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,25,How does hypnosis work?
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,26,Two theories attempt to answer this question: One theory views hypnosis as dissociation and the other theory views it as the performance of a social role.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,27,"According to the dissociation view, hypnosis is effectively a dissociated state of consciousness, much like our earlier example where you may drive to work, but you are only minimally aware of the process of driving because your attention is focused elsewhere."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,28,This theory is supported by Ernest Hilgard's research into hypnosis and pain.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,29,"In Hilgard's experiments, he induced participants into a state of hypnosis, and placed their arms into ice water."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,30,"Participants were told they would not feel pain, but they could press a button if they did; while they reported not feeling pain, they did, in fact, press the button, suggesting a dissociation of consciousness while in the hypnotic state (Hilgard &amp; Hilgard, 1994)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,31,"Taking a different approach to explain hypnosis, the social-cognitive theory of hypnosis sees people in hypnotic states as performing the social role of a hypnotized person."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,32,"As you will learn when you study social roles, people's behavior can be shaped by their expectations of how they should act in a given situation."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,33,"Some view a hypnotized person's behavior not as an altered or dissociated state of consciousness, but as their fulfillment of the social expectations for that role."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,34,Meditation         Meditation  is the act of focusing on a single target (such as the breath or a repeated sound) to increase awareness of the moment.
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,35,"While hypnosis is generally achieved through the interaction of a therapist and the person being treated, an individual can perform meditation alone."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,36,"Often, however, people wishing to learn to meditate receive some training in techniques to achieve a meditative state."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,37,"A meditative state, as shown by EEG recordings of newly-practicing meditators, is not an altered state of consciousness per se; however, patterns of brain waves exhibited by expert meditators may represent a unique state of consciousness (Fell, Axmacher, &amp; Haupt, 2010)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,38,"Although there are a number of different techniques in use, the central feature of all meditation is clearing the mind in order to achieve a state of relaxed awareness and focus (Chen et al., 2013; Lang et al., 2012)."
f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,39,Mindfulness meditation has recently become popular.

f89ed0da-ebf5-46d7-ad62-5d0815e5d88a@15,4,7,Other States of Consciousness,43,"Like hypnosis, meditation also shows promise in stress management, sleep quality (Caldwell, Harrison, Adams, Quin, &amp; Greeson, 2010), treatment of mood and anxiety disorders (Chen et al., 2013; Freeman et al., 2010; Vøllestad, Nielsen, &amp; Nielsen, 2012), and pain management (Reiner, Tibi, &amp; Lipsitz, 2013)."

2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,1,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Distinguish between sensation and perception   Describe the concepts of absolute threshold and difference threshold   Discuss the roles attention, motivation, and sensory adaptation play in perception            Sensation       What does it mean to sense something?"
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,2,Sensory receptors are specialized neurons that respond to specific types of stimuli.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,3,"When sensory information is detected by a sensory receptor,  sensation  has occurred."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,4,"For example, light that enters the eye causes chemical changes in cells that line the back of the eye."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,5,"These cells relay messages, in the form of action potentials (as you learned when studying biopsychology), to the central nervous system."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,6,The conversion from sensory stimulus energy to action potential is known as  transduction .
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,7,"You have probably known since elementary school that we have five senses: vision, hearing (audition), smell (olfaction), taste (gustation), and touch (somatosensation)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,8,It turns out that this notion of five senses is oversimplified.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,9,"We also have sensory systems that provide information about balance (the vestibular sense), body position and movement (proprioception and kinesthesia), pain (nociception), and temperature (thermoception)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,10,The sensitivity of a given sensory system to the relevant stimuli can be expressed as an absolute threshold.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,11,Absolute threshold  refers to the minimum amount of stimulus energy that must be present for the stimulus to be detected 50% of the time.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,12,Another way to think about this is by asking how dim can a light be or how soft can a sound be and still be detected half of the time.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,13,The sensitivity of our sensory receptors can be quite amazing.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,14,"It has been estimated that on a clear night, the most sensitive sensory cells in the back of the eye can detect a candle flame 30 miles away (Okawa &amp; Sampath, 2007)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,15,"Under quiet conditions, the hair cells (the receptor cells of the inner ear) can detect the tick of a clock 20 feet away (Galanter, 1962)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,16,It is also possible for us to get messages that are presented below the threshold for conscious awareness—these are called  subliminal messages .
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,17,A stimulus reaches a physiological threshold when it is strong enough to excite sensory receptors and send nerve impulses to the brain: This is an absolute threshold.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,18,"A message below that threshold is said to be subliminal: We receive it, but we are not consciously aware of it."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,19,"Over the years there has been a great deal of speculation about the use of subliminal messages in advertising, rock music, and self-help audio programs."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,20,"Research evidence shows that in laboratory settings, people can process and respond to information outside of awareness."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,21,"But this does not mean that we obey these messages like zombies; in fact, hidden messages have little effect on behavior outside the laboratory (Kunst-Wilson &amp; Zajonc, 1980; Rensink, 2004; Nelson, 2008; Radel, Sarrazin, Legrain, &amp; Gobancé, 2009; Loersch, Durso, &amp; Petty, 2013)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,22,Absolute thresholds are generally measured under incredibly controlled conditions in situations that are optimal for sensitivity.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,23,"Sometimes, we are more interested in how much difference in stimuli is required to detect a difference between them."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,24,This is known as the  just noticeable difference (jnd)  or  difference threshold .
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,25,"Unlike the absolute threshold, the difference threshold changes depending on the stimulus intensity."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,26,"As an example, imagine yourself in a very dark movie theater."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,27,"If an audience member were to receive a text message on her cell phone which caused her screen to light up, chances are that many people would notice the change in illumination in the theater."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,28,"However, if the same thing happened in a brightly lit arena during a basketball game, very few people would notice."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,29,"The cell phone brightness does not change, but its ability to be detected as a change in illumination varies dramatically between the two contexts."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,30,"Ernst Weber proposed this theory of change in difference threshold in the 1830s, and it has become known as Weber's law: The difference threshold is a constant fraction of the original stimulus, as the example illustrates."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,31,"Perception        While our sensory receptors are constantly collecting information from the environment, it is ultimately how we interpret that information that affects how we interact with the world."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,32,"Perception  refers to the way sensory information is organized, interpreted, and consciously experienced."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,33,Perception involves both bottom-up and top-down processing.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,34,Bottom-up processing  refers to the fact that perceptions are built from sensory input.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,35,"On the other hand, how we interpret those sensations is influenced by our available knowledge, our experiences, and our thoughts."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,36,This is called  top-down processing .
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,37,"One way to think of this concept is that sensation is a physical process, whereas perception is psychological."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,38,"For example, upon walking into a kitchen and smelling the scent of baking cinnamon rolls, the  sensation  is the scent receptors detecting the odor of cinnamon, but the  perception  may be ""Mmm, this smells like the bread Grandma used to bake when the family gathered for holidays."""
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,39,"Although our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception."

2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,44,"The clock is still ticking, and that information is still affecting sensory receptors of the auditory system."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,45,"The fact that you no longer perceive the sound demonstrates sensory adaptation and shows that while closely associated, sensation and perception are different."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,46,There is another factor that affects sensation and perception: attention.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,47,Attention plays a significant role in determining what is sensed versus what is perceived.

2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,56,"You would think that someone would notice the gorilla, right?"
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,57,"Nearly half of the people who watched the video didn't notice the gorilla at all, despite the fact that he was clearly visible for nine seconds."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,58,"Because participants were so focused on the number of times the white team was passing the ball, they completely tuned out other visual information."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,59,Failure to notice something that is completely visible because of a lack of attention is called  inattentional blindness .
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,60,"In a similar experiment, researchers tested inattentional blindness by asking participants to observe images moving across a computer screen."

2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,66,"If so, then you have experienced how motivation to detect a meaningful stimulus can shift our ability to discriminate between a true sensory stimulus and background noise."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,67,The ability to identify a stimulus when it is embedded in a distracting background is called  signal detection theory .

2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,70,Controllers need to be able to detect planes among many signals (blips) that appear on the radar screen and follow those planes as they move through the sky.
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,71,"In fact, the original work of the researcher who developed signal detection theory was focused on improving the sensitivity of air traffic controllers to plane blips (Swets, 1964)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,72,"Our perceptions can also be affected by our beliefs, values, prejudices, expectations, and life experiences."

2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,81,"People in Western cultures, for example, have a perceptual context of buildings with straight lines, what Segall's study called a carpentered world (Segall et al., 1966)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,82,"In contrast, people from certain non-Western cultures with an uncarpentered view, such as the Zulu of South Africa, whose villages are made up of round huts arranged in circles, are less susceptible to this illusion (Segall et al., 1999)."
2be0d9fb-4dcf-4848-bd06-a5f646c0e496@12,5,2,Sensation versus Perception,83,It is not just vision that is affected by cultural factors.

13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,4,"In addition, we will explore our ability to perceive color and depth."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,5,Figure   5.9        Our eyes take in sensory information that helps us understand the world around us.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,6,.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,7,Light waves are transmitted across the cornea and enter the eye through the pupil.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,8,The  cornea  is the transparent covering over the eye.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,9,"It serves as a barrier between the inner eye and the outside world, and it is involved in focusing light waves that enter the eye."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,10,"The  pupil  is the small opening in the eye through which light passes, and the size of the pupil can change as a function of light levels as well as emotional arousal."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,11,"When light levels are low, the pupil will become dilated, or expanded, to allow more light to enter the eye."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,12,"When light levels are high, the pupil will constrict, or become smaller, to reduce the amount of light that enters the eye."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,13,"The pupil's size is controlled by muscles that are connected to the  iris , which is the colored portion of the eye."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,14,Figure   5.10        The anatomy of the eye is illustrated in this diagram.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,15,"After passing through the pupil, light crosses the  lens , a curved, transparent structure that serves to provide additional focus."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,16,The lens is attached to muscles that can change its shape to aid in focusing light that is reflected from near or far objects.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,17,"In a normal-sighted individual, the lens will focus images perfectly on a small indentation in the back of the eye known as the  fovea , which is part of the  retina , the light-sensitive lining of the eye."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,18,The fovea contains densely packed specialized photoreceptor cells ( Figure 5.11 ).
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,19,"These  photoreceptor  cells, known as cones, are light-detecting cells."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,20,The  cones  are specialized types of photoreceptors that work best in bright light conditions.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,21,Cones are very sensitive to acute detail and provide tremendous spatial resolution.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,22,They also are directly involved in our ability to perceive color.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,23,"While cones are concentrated in the fovea, where images tend to be focused, rods, another type of photoreceptor, are located throughout the remainder of the retina."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,24,"Rods  are specialized photoreceptors that work well in low light conditions, and while they lack the spatial resolution and color function of the cones, they are involved in our vision in dimly lit environments as well as in our perception of movement on the periphery of our visual field."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,25,Figure   5.11        The two types of photoreceptors are shown in this image.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,26,Cones are colored green and rods are blue.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,27,We have all experienced the different sensitivities of rods and cones when making the transition from a brightly lit environment to a dimly lit environment.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,28,Imagine going to see a blockbuster movie on a clear summer day.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,29,"As you walk from the brightly lit lobby into the dark theater, you notice that you immediately have difficulty seeing much of anything."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,30,"After a few minutes, you begin to adjust to the darkness and can see the interior of the theater."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,31,"In the bright environment, your vision was dominated primarily by cone activity."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,32,"As you move to the dark environment, rod activity dominates, but there is a delay in transitioning between the phases."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,33,"If your rods do not transform light into nerve impulses as easily and efficiently as they should, you will have difficulty seeing in dim light, a condition known as night blindness."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,34,Rods and cones are connected (via several interneurons) to retinal ganglion cells.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,35,Axons from the retinal ganglion cells converge and exit through the back of the eye to form the  optic nerve .
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,36,The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,37,"There is a point in the visual field called the  blind spot : Even when light from a small object is focused on the blind spot, we do not see it."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,38,"We are not consciously aware of our blind spots for two reasons: First, each eye gets a slightly different view of the visual field; therefore, the blind spots do not overlap."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,39,"Second, our visual system fills in the blind spot so that although we cannot respond to visual information that occurs in that portion of the visual field, we are also not aware that information is missing."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,40,The optic nerve from each eye merges just below the brain at a point called the  optic chiasm .
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,41,"As  Figure 5.12  shows, the optic chiasm is an X-shaped structure that sits just below the cerebral cortex at the front of the brain."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,42,"At the point of the optic chiasm, information from the right visual field (which comes from both eyes) is sent to the left side of the brain, and information from the left visual field is sent to the right side of the brain."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,43,"Figure   5.12        This illustration shows the optic chiasm at the front of the brain and the pathways to the occipital lobe at the back of the brain, where visual sensations are processed into meaningful perceptions."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,44,"Once inside the brain, visual information is sent via a number of structures to the occipital lobe at the back of the brain for processing."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,45,"Visual information might be processed in parallel pathways which can generally be described as the ""what pathway"" and the ""where/how"" pathway."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,46,"The ""what pathway"" is involved in object recognition and identification, while the ""where/how pathway"" is involved with location in space and how one might interact with a particular visual stimulus (Milner &amp; Goodale, 2008; Ungerleider &amp; Haxby, 1994)."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,47,"For example, when you see a ball rolling down the street, the ""what pathway"" identifies what the object is, and the ""where/how pathway"" identifies its location or movement in space."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,48,"Color and Depth Perception         We do not see the world in black and white; neither do we see it as two-dimensional (2-D) or flat (just height and width, no depth)."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,49,"Let's look at how color vision works and how we perceive three dimensions (height, width, and depth)."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,50,Color Vision           Normal-sighted individuals have three different types of cones that mediate  color vision .
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,51,Each of these cone types is maximally sensitive to a slightly different wavelength of light.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,52,"According to the  trichromatic theory of color vision , shown in  Figure 5.13 , all colors in the spectrum can be produced by combining red, green, and blue."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,53,The three types of cones are each receptive to one of the colors.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,54,Figure   5.13        This figure illustrates the different sensitivities for the three cone types found in a normal-sighted individual.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,55,The trichromatic theory of color vision is not the only theory—another major theory of color vision is known as the  opponent-process theory .
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,56,"According to this theory, color is coded in opponent pairs: black-white, yellow-blue, and green-red."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,57,The basic idea is that some cells of the visual system are excited by one of the opponent colors and inhibited by the other.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,58,"So, a cell that was excited by wavelengths associated with green would be inhibited by wavelengths associated with red, and vice versa."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,59,One of the implications of opponent processing is that we do not experience greenish-reds or yellowish-blues as colors.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,60,Another implication is that this leads to the experience of negative afterimages.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,61,An  afterimage  describes the continuation of a visual sensation after removal of the stimulus.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,62,"For example, when you stare briefly at the sun and then look away from it, you may still perceive a spot of light although the stimulus (the sun) has been removed."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,63,"When color is involved in the stimulus, the color pairings identified in the opponent-process theory lead to a negative afterimage."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,64,You can test this concept using the flag in  Figure 5.14 .
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,65,Figure   5.14        Stare at the white dot for 30–60 seconds and then move your eyes to a blank piece of white paper.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,66,What do you see?
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,67,"This is known as a negative afterimage, and it provides empirical support for the opponent-process theory of color vision."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,68,But these two theories—the trichromatic theory of color vision and the opponent-process theory—are not mutually exclusive.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,69,Research has shown that they just apply to different levels of the nervous system.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,70,"For visual processing on the retina, trichromatic theory applies: the cones are responsive to three different wavelengths that represent red, blue, and green."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,71,"But once the signal moves past the retina on its way to the brain, the cells respond in a way consistent with opponent-process theory (Land, 1959; Kaiser, 1997)."

13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,73,Depth Perception         Our ability to perceive spatial relationships in three-dimensional (3-D) space is known as  depth perception .
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,74,"With depth perception, we can describe things as being in front, behind, above, below, or to the side of other things."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,75,"Our world is three-dimensional, so it makes sense that our mental representation of the world has three-dimensional properties."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,76,We use a variety of cues in a visual scene to establish our sense of depth.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,77,"Some of these are  binocular   cues , which means that they rely on the use of both eyes."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,78,"One example of a binocular depth cue is  binocular disparity , the slightly different view of the world that each of our eyes receives."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,79,"To experience this slightly different view, do this simple exercise: extend your arm fully and extend one of your fingers and focus on that finger."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,80,"Now, close your left eye without moving your head, then open your left eye and close your right eye without moving your head."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,81,You will notice that your finger seems to shift as you alternate between the two eyes because of the slightly different view each eye has of your finger.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,82,A 3-D movie works on the same principle: the special glasses you wear allow the two slightly different images projected onto the screen to be seen separately by your left and your right eye.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,83,"As your brain processes these images, you have the illusion that the leaping animal or running person is coming right toward you."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,84,"Although we rely on binocular cues to experience depth in our 3-D world, we can also perceive depth in 2-D arrays."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,85,Think about all the paintings and photographs you have seen.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,86,"Generally, you pick up on depth in these images even though the visual stimulus is 2-D."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,87,"When we do this, we are relying on a number of  monocular cues , or cues that require only one eye."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,88,"If you think you can't see depth with one eye, note that you don't bump into things when using only one eye while walking—and, in fact, we have more monocular cues than binocular cues."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,89,An example of a monocular cue would be what is known as linear perspective.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,90,Linear perspective  refers to the fact that we perceive depth when we see two parallel lines that seem to converge in an image ( Figure 5.15 ).
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,91,"Some other monocular depth cues are interposition, the partial overlap of objects, and the relative size and closeness of images to the horizon."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,92,"Figure   5.15        We perceive depth in a two-dimensional figure like this one through the use of monocular cues like linear perspective, like the parallel lines converging as the road narrows in the distance."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,93,"Dig Deeper     Stereoblindness   Bruce Bridgeman was born with an extreme case of lazy eye that resulted in him being stereoblind, or unable to respond to binocular cues of depth."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,94,"He relied heavily on monocular depth cues, but he never had a true appreciation of the 3-D nature of the world around him."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,95,This all changed one night in 2012 while Bruce was seeing a movie with his wife.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,96,"The movie the couple was going to see was shot in 3-D, and even though he thought it was a waste of money, Bruce paid for the 3-D glasses when he purchased his ticket."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,97,"As soon as the film began, Bruce put on the glasses and experienced something completely new."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,98,For the first time in his life he appreciated the true depth of the world around him.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,99,"Remarkably, his ability to perceive depth persisted outside of the movie theater."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,100,There are cells in the nervous system that respond to binocular depth cues.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,101,"Normally, these cells require activation during early development in order to persist, so experts familiar with Bruce's case (and others like his) assume that at some point in his development, Bruce must have experienced at least a fleeting moment of binocular vision."
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,102,It was enough to ensure the survival of the cells in the visual system tuned to binocular cues.
13eeec2d-014f-4d49-a6d0-bac8b83dcc71@14,5,4,Vision,103,"The mystery now is why it took Bruce nearly 70 years to have these cells activated (Peck, 2012)."

d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,2,"This translates into our ability to hear the sounds of nature, to appreciate the beauty of music, and to communicate with one another through spoken language."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,3,This section will provide an overview of the basic anatomy and function of the auditory system.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,4,"It will include a discussion of how the sensory stimulus is translated into neural impulses, where in the brain that information is processed, how we perceive pitch, and how we know where sound is coming from."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,5,Anatomy of the Auditory System       The ear can be separated into multiple sections.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,6,"The outer ear includes the  pinna , which is the visible part of the ear that protrudes from our heads, the auditory canal, and the  tympanic membrane , or eardrum."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,7,"The middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the  ossicles , which are named the  malleus  (or hammer),  incus  (or anvil), and the  stapes  (or stirrup)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,8,"The inner ear contains the semi-circular canals, which are involved in balance and movement (the vestibular sense), and the cochlea."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,9,"The  cochlea  is a fluid-filled, snail-shaped structure that contains the sensory receptor cells (hair cells) of the auditory system ( Figure 5.16 )."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,10,"Figure   5.16        The ear is divided into outer (pinna and tympanic membrane), middle (the three ossicles: malleus, incus, and stapes), and inner (cochlea and basilar membrane) divisions."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,11,"Sound waves travel along the auditory canal and strike the tympanic membrane, causing it to vibrate."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,12,This vibration results in movement of the three ossicles.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,13,"As the ossicles move, the stapes presses into a thin membrane of the cochlea known as the oval window."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,14,"As the stapes presses into the oval window, the fluid inside the cochlea begins to move, which in turn stimulates  hair cells , which are auditory receptor cells of the inner ear embedded in the basilar membrane."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,15,The  basilar membrane  is a thin strip of tissue within the cochlea.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,16,The activation of hair cells is a mechanical process: the stimulation of the hair cell ultimately leads to activation of the cell.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,17,"As hair cells become activated, they generate neural impulses that travel along the auditory nerve to the brain."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,18,"Auditory information is shuttled to the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and finally to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain for processing."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,19,"Like the visual system, there is also evidence suggesting that information about auditory recognition and localization is processed in parallel streams (Rauschecker &amp; Tian, 2000; Renier et al., 2009)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,20,Pitch Perception       Different frequencies of sound waves are associated with differences in our perception of the pitch of those sounds.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,21,"Low-frequency sounds are lower pitched, and high-frequency sounds are higher pitched."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,22,How does the auditory system differentiate among various pitches?
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,23,Several theories have been proposed to account for pitch perception.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,24,We'll discuss two of them here: temporal theory and place theory.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,25,The  temporal theory  of pitch perception asserts that frequency is coded by the activity level of a sensory neuron.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,26,This would mean that a given hair cell would fire action potentials related to the frequency of the sound wave.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,27,"While this is a very intuitive explanation, we detect such a broad range of frequencies (20–20,000 Hz) that the frequency of action potentials fired by hair cells cannot account for the entire range."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,28,"Because of properties related to sodium channels on the neuronal membrane that are involved in action potentials, there is a point at which a cell cannot fire any faster (Shamma, 2001)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,29,The  place theory  of pitch perception suggests that different portions of the basilar membrane are sensitive to sounds of different frequencies.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,30,"More specifically, the base of the basilar membrane responds best to high frequencies and the tip of the basilar membrane responds best to low frequencies."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,31,"Therefore, hair cells that are in the base portion would be labeled as high-pitch receptors, while those in the tip of basilar membrane would be labeled as low-pitch receptors (Shamma, 2001)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,32,"In reality, both theories explain different aspects of pitch perception."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,33,"At frequencies up to about 4000 Hz, it is clear that both the rate of action potentials and place contribute to our perception of pitch."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,34,"However, much higher frequency sounds can only be encoded using place cues (Shamma, 2001)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,35,Sound Localization       The ability to locate sound in our environments is an important part of  hearing .
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,36,Localizing sound could be considered similar to the way that we perceive depth in our visual fields.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,37,"Like the monocular and binocular cues that provided information about depth, the auditory system uses both  monaural  (one-eared) and  binaural  (two-eared) cues to localize sound."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,38,"Each pinna interacts with incoming sound waves differently, depending on the sound's source relative to our bodies."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,39,This interaction provides a monaural cue that is helpful in locating sounds that occur above or below and in front or behind us.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,40,"The sound waves received by your two ears from sounds that come from directly above, below, in front, or behind you would be identical; therefore, monaural cues are essential (Grothe, Pecka, &amp; McAlpine, 2010)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,41,"Binaural cues, on the other hand, provide information on the location of a sound along a horizontal axis by relying on differences in patterns of vibration of the eardrum between our two ears."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,42,"If a sound comes from an off-center location, it creates two types of binaural cues: interaural level differences and interaural timing differences."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,43,Interaural level difference  refers to the fact that a sound coming from the right side of your body is more intense at your right ear than at your left ear because of the attenuation of the sound wave as it passes through your head.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,44,Interaural timing difference  refers to the small difference in the time at which a given sound wave arrives at each ear ( Figure 5.17 ).
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,45,"Certain brain areas monitor these differences to construct where along a horizontal axis a sound originates (Grothe et al., 2010)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,46,Figure   5.17        Localizing sound involves the use of both monaural and binaural cues.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,47,Hearing Loss         Deafness  is the partial or complete inability to hear.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,48,"Some people are born deaf, which is known as  congenital deafness ."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,49,"Many others begin to suffer from  conductive hearing loss  because of age, genetic predisposition, or environmental effects, including exposure to extreme noise (noise-induced hearing loss, as shown in  Figure 5.18 ), certain illnesses (such as measles or mumps), or damage due to toxins (such as those found in certain solvents and metals)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,50,Figure   5.18        Environmental factors that can lead to conductive hearing loss include regular exposure to loud music or construction equipment.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,51,a) Rock musicians and (b) construction workers are at risk for this type of hearing loss.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,52,"Given the mechanical nature by which the sound wave stimulus is transmitted from the eardrum through the ossicles to the oval window of the cochlea, some degree of hearing loss is inevitable."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,53,"With conductive hearing loss, hearing problems are associated with a failure in the vibration of the eardrum and/or movement of the ossicles."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,54,These problems are often dealt with through devices like hearing aids that amplify incoming sound waves to make vibration of the eardrum and movement of the ossicles more likely to occur.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,55,"When the hearing problem is associated with a failure to transmit neural signals from the cochlea to the brain, it is called  sensorineural hearing loss ."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,56,One disease that results in sensorineural hearing loss is  Ménière's disease .
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,57,"Although not well understood, Ménière's disease results in a degeneration of inner ear structures that can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus (constant ringing or buzzing),  vertigo  (a sense of spinning), and an increase in pressure within the inner ear (Semaan &amp; Megerian, 2011)."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,58,"This kind of loss cannot be treated with hearing aids, but some individuals might be candidates for a cochlear implant as a treatment option."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,59,"Cochlear implants  are electronic devices that consist of a microphone, a speech processor, and an electrode array."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,60,The device receives incoming sound information and directly stimulates the auditory nerve to transmit information to the brain.

d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,63,"Deaf Culture   In the United States and other places around the world, deaf people have their own language, schools, and customs."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,64,This is called  deaf culture .
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,65,"In the United States, deaf individuals often communicate using American Sign Language (ASL); ASL has no verbal component and is based entirely on visual signs and gestures."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,66,The primary mode of communication is signing.
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,67,"One of the values of deaf culture is to continue traditions like using sign language rather than teaching deaf children to try to speak, read lips, or have cochlear implant surgery."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,68,"When a child is diagnosed as deaf, parents have difficult decisions to make."
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,69,Should the child be enrolled in mainstream schools and taught to verbalize and read lips?
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,70,Or should the child be sent to a school for deaf children to learn ASL and have significant exposure to deaf culture?
d2729fa5-7a9b-42c8-acf8-53f07c0e9f2a@17,5,5,Hearing,71,Do you think there might be differences in the way that parents approach these decisions depending on whether or not they are also deaf?

370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,4,The Chemical Senses       Taste (gustation) and  smell  (olfaction) are called chemical senses because both have sensory receptors that respond to molecules in the food we eat or in the air we breathe.
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,5,There is a pronounced interaction between our chemical senses.
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,6,"For example, when we describe the flavor of a given food, we are really referring to both gustatory and olfactory properties of the food working in combination."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,7,"Taste (Gustation)         You have learned since elementary school that there are four basic groupings of taste: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,8,"Research demonstrates, however, that we have at least six  taste  groupings."

370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,13,Taste buds  are formed by groupings of taste receptor cells with hair-like extensions that protrude into the central pore of the taste bud ( Figure 5.19 ).
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,14,"Taste buds have a life cycle of ten days to two weeks, so even destroying some by burning your tongue won't have any long-term effect; they just grow right back."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,15,"Taste molecules bind to receptors on this extension and cause chemical changes within the sensory cell that result in neural impulses being transmitted to the brain via different nerves, depending on where the receptor is located."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,16,"Taste information is transmitted to the medulla, thalamus, and limbic system, and to the gustatory cortex, which is tucked underneath the overlap between the frontal and temporal lobes (Maffei, Haley, &amp; Fontanini, 2012; Roper, 2013)."

370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,38,"In addition to the receptors located in the skin, there are also a number of free nerve endings that serve sensory functions."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,39,"These nerve endings respond to a variety of different types of touch-related stimuli and serve as sensory receptors for both  thermoception  (temperature perception) and  nociception  (a signal indicating potential harm and maybe pain) (Garland, 2012; Petho &amp; Reeh, 2012; Spray, 1986)."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,40,"Sensory information collected from the receptors and free nerve endings travels up the spinal cord and is transmitted to regions of the medulla, thalamus, and ultimately to somatosensory cortex, which is located in the postcentral gyrus of the parietal lobe."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,41,Pain Perception         Pain is an unpleasant experience that involves both physical and psychological components.
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,42,"Feeling pain is quite adaptive because it makes us aware of an injury, and it motivates us to remove ourselves from the cause of that injury."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,43,"In addition, pain also makes us less likely to suffer additional injury because we will be gentler with our injured body parts."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,44,"Generally speaking, pain can be considered to be neuropathic or inflammatory in nature."

370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,59,"As  Figure 5.22  shows, the major sensory organs (utricle, saccule, and the three semicircular canals) of this system are located next to the cochlea in the inner ear."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,60,"The vestibular organs are fluid-filled and have hair cells, similar to the ones found in the auditory system, which respond to movement of the head and gravitational forces."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,61,"When these hair cells are stimulated, they send signals to the brain via the vestibular nerve."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,62,"Although we may not be consciously aware of our vestibular system's sensory information under normal circumstances, its importance is apparent when we experience motion sickness and/or dizziness related to infections of the inner ear (Khan &amp; Chang, 2013)."

370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,65,"In addition to maintaining balance, the vestibular system collects information critical for controlling movement and the reflexes that move various parts of our bodies to compensate for changes in body position."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,66,"Therefore, both  proprioception  (perception of body position) and  kinesthesia  (perception of the body's movement through space) interact with information provided by the vestibular system."
370f4538-a2ec-4bf7-a3f4-c00b15548c04@13,5,6,The Other Senses,67,"These sensory systems also gather information from receptors that respond to stretch and tension in muscles, joints, skin, and tendons (Lackner &amp; DiZio, 2005; Proske, 2006; Proske &amp; Gandevia, 2012)."

70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,2,"Wertheimer, and his assistants Wolfgang Köhler and Kurt Koffka, who later became his partners, believed that perception involved more than simply combining sensory stimuli."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,3,This belief led to a new movement within the field of psychology known as  Gestalt psychology .
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,4,"The word  gestalt  literally means form or pattern, but its use reflects the idea that the whole is different from the sum of its parts."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,5,"In other words, the brain creates a perception that is more than simply the sum of available sensory inputs, and it does so in predictable ways."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,6,Gestalt psychologists translated these predictable ways into principles by which we organize sensory information.
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,7,"As a result, Gestalt psychology has been extremely influential in the area of sensation and perception (Rock &amp; Palmer, 1990)."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,8,One Gestalt principle is the  figure-ground relationship .
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,9,"According to this principle, we tend to segment our visual world into figure and ground."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,10,"Figure is the object or person that is the focus of the visual field, while the ground is the background."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,11,"As  Figure 5.23  shows, our perception can vary tremendously, depending on what is perceived as figure and what is perceived as ground."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,12,"Presumably, our ability to interpret sensory information depends on what we label as figure and what we label as ground in any particular case, although this assumption has been called into question (Peterson &amp; Gibson, 1994; Vecera &amp; O'Reilly, 1998)."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,13,Figure   5.23        The concept of figure-ground relationship explains why this image can be perceived either as a vase or as a pair of faces.
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,14,Another Gestalt principle for organizing sensory stimuli into meaningful perception is  proximity .
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,15,"This principle asserts that things that are close to one another tend to be grouped together, as  Figure 5.24  illustrates."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,16,Figure   5.24        The Gestalt principle of proximity suggests that you see (a) one block of dots on the left side and (b) three columns on the right side.
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,17,How we read something provides another illustration of the proximity concept.
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,18,"For example, we read this sentence like this, notl iket hiso rt hat."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,19,"We group the letters of a given word together because there are no spaces between the letters, and we perceive words because there are spaces between each word."

70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,23,"According to this principle, things that are alike tend to be grouped together ( Figure 5.25 )."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,24,"For example, when watching a football game, we tend to group individuals based on the colors of their uniforms."

70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,27,We are grouping these dots according to the principle of similarity.
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,28,Two additional Gestalt principles are the law of  continuity  (or  good continuation ) and  closure .
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,29,"The law of continuity suggests that we are more likely to perceive continuous, smooth flowing lines rather than jagged, broken lines ( Figure 5.26 )."
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,30,The  principle of closure  states that we organize our perceptions into complete objects rather than as a series of parts ( Figure 5.27 ).
70e73101-1feb-4607-b747-cd1926a9f015@11,5,7,Gestalt Principles of Perception,31,"Figure   5.26        Good continuation would suggest that we are more likely to perceive this as two overlapping lines, rather than four lines meeting in the center."

40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,9,Reflexes  are a motor or neural reaction to a specific stimulus in the environment.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,10,"They tend to be simpler than instincts, involve the activity of specific body parts and systems (e.g., the knee-jerk reflex and the contraction of the pupil in bright light), and involve more primitive centers of the central nervous system (e.g., the spinal cord and the medulla)."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,11,"In contrast,  instincts  are innate behaviors that are triggered by a broader range of events, such as aging and the change of seasons."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,12,"They are more complex patterns of behavior, involve movement of the organism as a whole (e.g., sexual activity and migration), and involve higher brain centers."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,13,Both reflexes and instincts help an organism adapt to its environment and do not have to be learned.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,14,"For example, every healthy human baby has a sucking reflex, present at birth."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,15,"Babies are born knowing how to suck on a nipple, whether artificial (from a bottle) or human."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,16,"Nobody teaches the baby to suck, just as no one teaches a sea turtle hatchling to move toward the ocean."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,17,"Learning, like reflexes and instincts, allows an organism to adapt to its environment."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,18,"But unlike instincts and reflexes, learned behaviors involve change and experience:  learning  is a relatively permanent change in behavior or knowledge that results from experience."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,19,"In contrast to the innate behaviors discussed above, learning involves acquiring knowledge and skills through experience."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,20,"Looking back at our surfing scenario, Julian will have to spend much more time training with his surfboard before he learns how to ride the waves like his father."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,21,"Learning to surf, as well as any complex learning process (e.g., learning about the discipline of psychology), involves a complex interaction of conscious and unconscious processes."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,22,Learning has traditionally been studied in terms of its simplest components—the associations our minds automatically make between events.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,23,Our minds have a natural tendency to connect events that occur closely together or in sequence.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,24,Associative learning  occurs when an organism makes connections between stimuli or events that occur together in the environment.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,25,"You will see that associative learning is central to all three basic learning processes discussed in this chapter; classical conditioning tends to involve unconscious processes, operant conditioning tends to involve conscious processes, and observational learning adds social and cognitive layers to all the basic associative processes, both conscious and unconscious."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,26,"These learning processes will be discussed in detail later in the chapter, but it is helpful to have a brief overview of each as you begin to explore how learning is understood from a psychological perspective."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,27,"In classical conditioning, also known as Pavlovian conditioning, organisms learn to associate events—or stimuli—that repeatedly happen together."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,28,We experience this process throughout our daily lives.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,29,"For example, you might see a flash of lightning in the sky during a storm and then hear a loud boom of thunder."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,30,The sound of the thunder naturally makes you jump (loud noises have that effect by reflex).
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,31,"Because lightning reliably predicts the impending boom of thunder, you may associate the two and jump when you see lightning."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,32,Psychological researchers study this associative process by focusing on what can be seen and measured—behaviors.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,33,"Researchers ask if one stimulus triggers a reflex, can we train a different stimulus to trigger that same reflex?"
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,34,"In operant conditioning, organisms learn, again, to associate events—a behavior and its consequence (reinforcement or punishment)."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,35,"A pleasant consequence encourages more of that behavior in the future, whereas a punishment deters the behavior."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,36,"Imagine you are teaching your dog, Hodor, to sit."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,37,"You tell Hodor to sit, and give him a treat when he does."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,38,"After repeated experiences, Hodor begins to associate the act of sitting with receiving a treat."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,39,He learns that the consequence of sitting is that he gets a doggie biscuit ( Figure 6.2 ).
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,40,"Conversely, if the dog is punished when exhibiting a behavior, it becomes conditioned to avoid that behavior (e.g., receiving a small shock when crossing the boundary of an invisible electric fence)."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,41,"Figure   6.2        In operant conditioning, a response is associated with a consequence."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,42,This dog has learned that certain behaviors result in receiving a treat.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,43,Observational learning extends the effective range of both classical and operant conditioning.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,44,"In contrast to classical and operant conditioning, in which learning occurs only through direct experience, observational learning is the process of watching others and then imitating what they do."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,45,A lot of learning among humans and other animals comes from observational learning.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,46,"To get an idea of the extra effective range that observational learning brings, consider Ben and his son Julian from the introduction."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,47,"How might observation help Julian learn to surf, as opposed to learning by trial and error alone?"
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,48,"By watching his father, he can imitate the moves that bring success and avoid the moves that lead to failure."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,49,Can you think of something you have learned how to do after watching someone else?
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,50,"All of the approaches covered in this chapter are part of a particular tradition in psychology, called behaviorism, which we discuss in the next section."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,51,"However, these approaches do not represent the entire study of learning."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,52,"Separate traditions of learning have taken shape within different fields of psychology, such as memory and cognition, so you will find that other chapters will round out your understanding of the topic."
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,53,Over time these traditions tend to converge.
40dc9792-23fb-4394-b059-58abc395a76f@10,6,2,,54,"For example, in this chapter you will see how cognition has come to play a larger role in behaviorism, whose more extreme adherents once insisted that behaviors are triggered by the environment with no intervening thought."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,1,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Explain how classical conditioning occurs   Summarize the processes of acquisition, extinction, spontaneous recovery, generalization, and discrimination       Does the name Ivan  Pavlov  ring a bell?"
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,2,"Even if you are new to the study of psychology, chances are that you have heard of Pavlov and his famous dogs."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,3,"Pavlov (1849–1936), a Russian scientist, performed extensive research on dogs and is best known for his experiments in classical  conditioning  ( Figure 6.3 )."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,4,"As we discussed briefly in the previous section,  classical conditioning  is a process by which we learn to associate stimuli and, consequently, to anticipate events."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,5,Figure   6.3        Ivan Pavlov's research on the digestive system of dogs unexpectedly led to his discovery of the learning process now known as classical conditioning.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,6,Pavlov came to his conclusions about how learning occurs completely by accident.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,7,"Pavlov was a physiologist, not a psychologist."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,8,"Physiologists study the life processes of organisms, from the molecular level to the level of cells, organ systems, and entire organisms."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,9,"Pavlov's area of interest was the digestive system (Hunt, 2007)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,10,"In his studies with dogs, Pavlov surgically implanted tubes inside dogs' cheeks to collect saliva."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,11,He then measured the amount of saliva produced in response to various foods.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,12,"Over time, Pavlov (1927) observed that the dogs began to salivate not only at the taste of food, but also at the sight of food, at the sight of an empty food bowl, and even at the sound of the laboratory assistants' footsteps."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,13,"Salivating to food in the mouth is reflexive, so no learning is involved."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,14,"However, dogs don't naturally salivate at the sight of an empty bowl or the sound of footsteps."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,15,"These unusual responses intrigued Pavlov, and he wondered what accounted for what he called the dogs' ""psychic secretions"" (Pavlov, 1927)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,16,"To explore this phenomenon in an objective manner, Pavlov designed a series of carefully controlled experiments to see which stimuli would cause the dogs to salivate."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,17,"He was able to train the dogs to salivate in response to stimuli that clearly had nothing to do with food, such as the sound of a bell, a light, and a touch on the leg."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,18,"Through his experiments, Pavlov realized that an organism has two types of responses to its environment: (1) unconditioned (unlearned) responses, or reflexes, and (2) conditioned (learned) responses."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,19,"In Pavlov's experiments, the dogs salivated each time meat powder was presented to them."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,20,The meat powder in this situation was an  unconditioned stimulus (UCS) : a stimulus that elicits a reflexive response in an organism.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,21,The dogs' salivation was an  unconditioned response (UCR) : a natural (unlearned) reaction to a given stimulus.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,22,"Before conditioning, think of the dogs' stimulus and response like this:          Meat powder (UCS)   ->   Salivation (UCR)     Meat powder (UCS)   ->   Salivation (UCR)       In classical conditioning, a neutral stimulus is presented immediately before an unconditioned stimulus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,23,Pavlov would sound a tone (like ringing a bell) and then give the dogs the meat powder ( Figure 6.4 ).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,24,"The tone was the  neutral stimulus (NS) , which is a stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,25,"Prior to conditioning, the dogs did not salivate when they just heard the tone because the tone had no association for the dogs."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,26,"Quite simply this pairing means:        Tone (NS) + Meat Powder (UCS)   ->   Salivation (UCR)        Tone (NS) + Meat Powder (UCS)   ->   Salivation (UCR)        When Pavlov paired the tone with the meat powder over and over again, the previously neutral stimulus (the tone) also began to elicit salivation from the dogs."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,27,"Thus, the neutral stimulus became the  conditioned stimulus (CS) , which is a stimulus that elicits a response after repeatedly being paired with an unconditioned stimulus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,28,"Eventually, the dogs began to salivate to the tone alone, just as they previously had salivated at the sound of the assistants' footsteps."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,29,The behavior caused by the conditioned stimulus is called the  conditioned response (CR) .
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,30,"In the case of Pavlov's dogs, they had learned to associate the tone (CS) with being fed, and they began to salivate (CR) in anticipation of food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,31,"Tone (CS)   ->   Salivation (CR)     Tone (CS)   ->   Salivation (CR)                  Figure   6.4        Before conditioning, an unconditioned stimulus (food) produces an unconditioned response (salivation), and a neutral stimulus (bell) does not produce a response."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,32,"During conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus (food) is presented repeatedly just after the presentation of the neutral stimulus (bell)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,33,"After conditioning, the neutral stimulus alone produces a conditioned response (salivation), thus becoming a conditioned stimulus."

8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,38,"Let's say you have a cat named Tiger, who is quite spoiled."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,39,"You keep her food in a separate cabinet, and you also have a special electric can opener that you use only to open cans of cat food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,40,"For every meal, Tiger hears the distinctive sound of the electric can opener (""zzhzhz"") and then gets her food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,41,"Tiger quickly learns that when she hears ""zzhzhz"" she is about to get fed."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,42,What do you think Tiger does when she hears the electric can opener?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,43,She will likely get excited and run to where you are preparing her food.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,44,This is an example of classical conditioning.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,45,"In this case, what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR?"
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,46,What if the cabinet holding Tiger's food becomes squeaky?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,47,"In that case, Tiger hears ""squeak"" (the cabinet), ""zzhzhz"" (the electric can opener), and then she gets her food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,48,"Tiger will learn to get excited when she hears the ""squeak"" of the cabinet."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,49,"Pairing a new neutral stimulus (""squeak"") with the conditioned stimulus (""zzhzhz"") is called  higher-order conditioning , or  second-order conditioning ."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,50,This means you are using the conditioned stimulus of the can opener to condition another stimulus: the squeaky cabinet ( Figure 6.5 ).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,51,It is hard to achieve anything above second-order conditioning.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,52,"For example, if you ring a bell, open the cabinet (""squeak""), use the can opener (""zzhzhz""), and then feed Tiger, Tiger will likely never get excited when hearing the bell alone."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,53,"Figure   6.5        In higher-order conditioning, an established conditioned stimulus is paired with a new neutral stimulus (the second-order stimulus), so that eventually the new stimulus also elicits the conditioned response, without the initial conditioned stimulus being presented."

8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,60,"As soon as Kate and Scott reached Stingray City, over two dozen stingrays surrounded their tour boat."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,61,"The couple slipped into the water with bags of squid, the stingrays' favorite treat."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,62,The swarm of stingrays bumped and rubbed up against their legs like hungry cats ( Figure 6.6 ).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,63,"Kate and Scott were able to feed, pet, and even kiss (for luck) these amazing creatures."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,64,"Then all the squid was gone, and so were the stingrays."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,65,Figure   6.6        Kate holds a southern stingray at Stingray City in the Cayman Islands.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,66,These stingrays have been classically conditioned to associate the sound of a boat motor with food provided by tourists.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,67,"Classical conditioning also applies to humans, even babies."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,68,"For example, Sara buys formula in blue canisters for her six-month-old daughter, Angelina."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,69,"Whenever Sara takes out a formula container, Angelina gets excited, tries to reach toward the food, and most likely salivates."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,70,Why does Angelina get excited when she sees the formula canister?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,71,"What are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR here?"
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,72,"So far, all of the examples have involved food, but classical conditioning extends beyond the basic need to be fed."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,73,Consider our earlier example of a dog whose owners install an invisible electric dog fence.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,74,A small electrical shock (unconditioned stimulus) elicits discomfort (unconditioned response).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,75,"When the unconditioned stimulus (shock) is paired with a neutral stimulus (the edge of a yard), the dog associates the discomfort (unconditioned response) with the edge of the yard (conditioned stimulus) and stays within the set boundaries."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,76,"In this example, the edge of the yard  elicits fear and anxiety in the dog."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,77,Fear and anxiety are the conditioned response.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,78,"Link to Learning     For a humorous look at conditioning, watch this  video clip  from the television show  The Office , where Jim conditions Dwight to expect a breath mint every time Jim's computer makes a specific sound."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,79,"General Processes in Classical Conditioning   Now that you know how classical conditioning works and have seen several examples, let's take a look at some of the general processes involved."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,80,"In classical conditioning, the initial period of learning is known as  acquisition , when an organism learns to connect a neutral stimulus and an unconditioned stimulus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,81,"During acquisition, the neutral stimulus begins to elicit the conditioned response, and eventually the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus capable of eliciting the conditioned response by itself."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,82,Timing is important for conditioning to occur.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,83,"Typically, there should only be a brief interval between presentation of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,84,"Depending on what is being conditioned, sometimes this interval is as little as five seconds (Chance, 2009)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,85,"However, with other types of conditioning, the interval can be up to several hours."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,86,Taste aversion  is a type of conditioning in which an interval of several hours may pass between the conditioned stimulus (something ingested) and the unconditioned stimulus (nausea or illness).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,87,Here's how it works.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,88,"Between classes, you and a friend grab a quick lunch from a food cart on campus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,89,You share a dish of chicken curry and head off to your next class.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,90,"A few hours later, you feel nauseous and become ill."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,91,"Although your friend is fine and you determine that you have intestinal flu (the food is not the culprit), you've developed a taste aversion; the next time you are at a restaurant and someone orders curry, you immediately feel ill."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,92,"While the chicken dish is not what made you sick, you are experiencing taste aversion: you've been conditioned to be averse to a food after a single, negative experience."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,93,How does this occur—conditioning based on a single instance and involving an extended time lapse between the event and the negative stimulus?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,94,"Research into taste aversion suggests that this response may be an evolutionary adaptation designed to help organisms quickly learn to avoid harmful foods (Garcia &amp; Rusiniak, 1980; Garcia &amp; Koelling, 1966)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,95,"Not only may this contribute to species survival via natural selection, but it may also help us develop strategies for challenges such as helping cancer patients through the nausea induced by certain treatments (Holmes, 1993; Jacobsen et al., 1993; Hutton, Baracos, &amp; Wismer, 2007; Skolin et al., 2006)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,96,"Once we have established the connection between the unconditioned stimulus and the conditioned stimulus, how do we break that connection and get the dog, cat, or child to stop responding?"
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,97,"In Tiger's case, imagine what would happen if you stopped using the electric can opener for her food and began to use it only for human food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,98,"Now, Tiger would hear the can opener, but she would not get food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,99,"In classical conditioning terms, you would be giving the conditioned stimulus, but not the unconditioned stimulus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,100,Pavlov explored this scenario in his experiments with dogs: sounding the tone without giving the dogs the meat powder.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,101,Soon the dogs stopped responding to the tone.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,102,Extinction  is the decrease in the conditioned response when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer presented with the conditioned stimulus.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,103,"When presented with the conditioned stimulus alone, the dog, cat, or other organism would show a weaker and weaker response, and finally no response."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,104,"In classical conditioning terms, there is a gradual weakening and disappearance of the conditioned response."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,105,What happens when learning is not used for a while—when what was learned lies dormant?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,106,"As we just discussed, Pavlov found that when he repeatedly presented the bell (conditioned stimulus) without the meat powder (unconditioned stimulus), extinction occurred; the dogs stopped salivating to the bell."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,107,"However, after a couple of hours of resting from this extinction training, the dogs again began to salivate when Pavlov rang the bell."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,108,"What do you think would happen with Tiger's behavior if your electric can opener broke, and you did not use it for several months?"
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,109,"When you finally got it fixed and started using it to open Tiger's food again, Tiger would remember the association between the can opener and her food—she would get excited and run to the kitchen when she heard the sound."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,110,The behavior of Pavlov's dogs and Tiger illustrates a concept Pavlov called  spontaneous recovery : the return of a previously extinguished conditioned response following a rest period ( Figure 6.7 ).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,111,"Figure   6.7        This is the curve of acquisition, extinction, and spontaneous recovery."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,112,The rising curve shows the conditioned response quickly getting stronger through the repeated pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus (acquisition).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,113,"Then the curve decreases, which shows how the conditioned response weakens when only the conditioned stimulus is presented (extinction)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,114,"After a break or pause from conditioning, the conditioned response reappears (spontaneous recovery)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,115,"Of course, these processes also apply in humans."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,116,"For example, let's say that every day when you walk to campus, an ice cream truck passes your route."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,117,"Day after day, you hear the truck's music (neutral stimulus), so you finally stop and purchase a chocolate ice cream bar."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,118,You take a bite (unconditioned stimulus) and then your mouth waters (unconditioned response).
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,119,"This initial period of learning is known as acquisition, when you begin to connect the neutral stimulus (the sound of the truck) and the unconditioned stimulus (the taste of the chocolate ice cream in your mouth)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,120,"During acquisition, the conditioned response gets stronger and stronger through repeated pairings of the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,121,"Several days (and ice cream bars) later, you notice that your mouth begins to water (conditioned response) as soon as you hear the truck's musical jingle—even before you bite into the ice cream bar."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,122,Then one day you head down the street.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,123,"You hear the truck's music (conditioned stimulus), and your mouth waters (conditioned response)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,124,"However, when you get to the truck, you discover that they are all out of ice cream."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,125,You leave disappointed.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,126,"The next few days you pass by the truck and hear the music, but don't stop to get an ice cream bar because you're running late for class."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,127,"You begin to salivate less and less when you hear the music, until by the end of the week, your mouth no longer waters when you hear the tune."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,128,This illustrates extinction.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,129,"The conditioned response weakens when only the conditioned stimulus (the sound of the truck) is presented, without being followed by the unconditioned stimulus (chocolate ice cream in the mouth)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,130,Then the weekend comes.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,131,"You don't have to go to class, so you don't pass the truck."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,132,Monday morning arrives and you take your usual route to campus.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,133,You round the corner and hear the truck again.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,134,What do you think happens?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,135,Your mouth begins to water again.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,136,Why?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,137,"After a break from conditioning, the conditioned response reappears, which indicates spontaneous recovery."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,138,"Acquisition and extinction involve the strengthening and weakening, respectively, of a learned association."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,139,Two other learning processes—stimulus discrimination and stimulus generalization—are involved in distinguishing which stimuli will trigger the learned association.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,140,"Animals (including humans) need to distinguish between stimuli—for example, between sounds that predict a threatening event and sounds that do not—so that they can respond appropriately (such as running away if the sound is threatening)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,141,"When an organism learns to respond differently to various stimuli that are similar, it is called  stimulus discrimination ."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,142,"In classical conditioning terms, the organism demonstrates the conditioned response only to the conditioned stimulus."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,143,"Pavlov's dogs discriminated between the basic tone that sounded before they were fed and other tones (e.g., the doorbell), because the other sounds did not predict the arrival of food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,144,"Similarly, Tiger, the cat, discriminated between the sound of the can opener and the sound of the electric mixer."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,145,"When the electric mixer is going, Tiger is not about to be fed, so she does not come running to the kitchen looking for food."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,146,"On the other hand, when an organism demonstrates the conditioned response to stimuli that are similar to the condition stimulus, it is called  stimulus generalization , the opposite of stimulus discrimination."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,147,"The more similar a stimulus is to the condition stimulus, the more likely the organism is to give the conditioned response."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,148,"For instance, if the electric mixer sounds very similar to the electric can opener, Tiger may come running after hearing its sound."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,149,"But if you do not feed her following the electric mixer sound, and you continue to feed her consistently after the electric can opener sound, she will quickly learn to discriminate between the two sounds (provided they are sufficiently dissimilar that she can tell them apart)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,150,"Sometimes, classical conditioning can lead to habituation."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,151,Habituation  occurs when we learn not to respond to a stimulus that is presented repeatedly without change.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,152,"As the stimulus occurs over and over, we learn not to focus our attention on it."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,153,"For example, imagine that your neighbor or roommate constantly has the television blaring."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,154,This background noise is distracting and makes it difficult for you to focus when you're studying.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,155,"However, over time, you become accustomed to the stimulus of the television noise, and eventually you hardly notice it any longer."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,156,"Behaviorism   John B.  Watson , shown in  Figure 6.8 , is considered the founder of behaviorism."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,157,"Behaviorism is a school of thought that arose during the first part of the 20th century, which incorporates elements of Pavlov's classical conditioning (Hunt, 2007)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,158,"In stark contrast with Freud, who considered the reasons for behavior to be hidden in the unconscious, Watson championed the idea that all behavior can be studied as a simple stimulus-response reaction, without regard for internal processes."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,159,"Watson argued that in order for psychology to become a legitimate science, it must shift its concern away from internal mental processes because mental processes cannot be seen or measured."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,160,"Instead, he asserted that psychology must focus on outward observable behavior that can be measured."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,161,Figure   6.8        John B. Watson used the principles of classical conditioning in the study of human emotion.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,162,Watson's ideas were influenced by Pavlov's work.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,163,"According to Watson, human behavior, just like animal behavior, is primarily the result of conditioned responses."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,164,"Whereas Pavlov's work with dogs involved the conditioning of reflexes, Watson believed the same principles could be extended to the conditioning of human emotions (Watson, 1919)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,165,Thus began Watson's work with his graduate student Rosalie Rayner and a baby called Little Albert.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,166,"Through their experiments with Little Albert, Watson and Rayner (1920) demonstrated how fears can be conditioned."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,167,"In 1920, Watson was the chair of the psychology department at Johns Hopkins University."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,168,"Through his position at the university he came to meet Little Albert's mother, Arvilla Merritte, who worked at a campus hospital (DeAngelis, 2010)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,169,Watson offered her a dollar to allow her son to be the subject of his experiments in classical conditioning.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,170,"Through these experiments, Little Albert was exposed to and conditioned to fear certain things."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,171,"Initially he was presented with various neutral stimuli, including a rabbit, a dog, a monkey, masks, cotton wool, and a white rat."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,172,He was not afraid of any of these things.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,173,"Then Watson, with the help of Rayner, conditioned Little Albert to associate these stimuli with an emotion—fear."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,174,"For example, Watson handed Little Albert the white rat, and Little Albert enjoyed playing with it."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,175,"Then Watson made a loud sound, by striking a hammer against a metal bar hanging behind Little Albert's head, each time Little Albert touched the rat."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,176,Little Albert was frightened by the sound—demonstrating a reflexive fear of sudden loud noises—and began to cry.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,177,Watson repeatedly paired the loud sound with the white rat.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,178,Soon Little Albert became frightened by the white rat alone.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,179,"In this case, what are the UCS, CS, UCR, and CR?"
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,180,"Days later, Little Albert demonstrated stimulus generalization—he became afraid of other furry things: a rabbit, a furry coat, and even a Santa Claus mask ( Figure 6.9 )."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,181,"Watson had succeeded in conditioning a fear response in Little Albert, thus demonstrating that emotions could become conditioned responses."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,182,"It had been Watson's intention to produce a phobia—a persistent, excessive fear of a specific object or situation— through conditioning alone, thus countering Freud's view that phobias are caused by deep, hidden conflicts in the mind."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,183,"However, there is no evidence that Little Albert experienced phobias in later years."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,184,"Little Albert's mother moved away, ending the experiment."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,185,"While Watson's research provided new insight into conditioning, it would be considered unethical by today's standards."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,186,"Figure   6.9        Through stimulus generalization, Little Albert came to fear furry things, including Watson in a Santa Claus mask."

8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,191,Think about the car commercials you have seen on television.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,192,Many of them feature an attractive model.
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,193,"By associating the model with the car being advertised, you come to see the car as being desirable (Cialdini, 2008)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,194,"You may be asking yourself, does this advertising technique actually work?"
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,195,"According to Cialdini (2008), men who viewed a car commercial that included an attractive model later rated the car as being faster, more appealing, and better designed than did men who viewed an advertisement for the same car minus the model."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,196,Have you ever noticed how quickly advertisers cancel contracts with a famous athlete following a scandal?
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,197,"As far as the advertiser is concerned, that athlete is no longer associated with positive feelings; therefore, the athlete cannot be used as an unconditioned stimulus to condition the public to associate positive feelings (the unconditioned response) with their product (the conditioned stimulus)."
8525bfc0-820f-4b5d-8b0f-786f94d468dc@13,6,3,Classical Conditioning,198,"Now that you are aware of how associative learning works, see if you can find examples of these types of advertisements on television, in magazines, or on the Internet."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,2,"Remember that in classical conditioning, something in the environment triggers a reflex automatically, and researchers train the organism to react to a different stimulus."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,4,"In operant conditioning, organisms learn to associate a behavior and its consequence ( Table 6.1 )."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,5,A pleasant consequence makes that behavior more likely to be repeated in the future.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,6,"For example, Spirit, a dolphin at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, does a flip in the air when her trainer blows a whistle."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,7,The consequence is that she gets a fish.

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,9,"The neutral stimulus eventually becomes the conditioned stimulus, which brings about the conditioned response (salivation)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,10,"The target behavior is followed by reinforcement or punishment to either strengthen or weaken it, so that the learner is more likely to exhibit the desired behavior in the future."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,12,The stimulus (either reinforcement or punishment) occurs soon after the response.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,13,"Table   6.1      Classical and Operant Conditioning Compared     Psychologist B. F.  Skinner  saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are reflexively elicited, and it doesn't account for new behaviors such as riding a bike."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,14,He proposed a theory about how such behaviors come about.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,15,Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the consequences we receive for the behavior: the reinforcements and punishments.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,16,"His idea that learning is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist Edward  Thorndike ."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,17,"According to the  law of effect , behaviors that are followed by consequences that are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated, and behaviors that are followed by unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated (Thorndike, 1911)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,18,"Essentially, if an organism does something that brings about a desired result, the organism is more likely to do it again."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,19,"If an organism does something that does not bring about a desired result, the organism is less likely to do it again."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,20,An example of the law of effect is in employment.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,21,One of the reasons (and often the main reason) we show up for work is because we get paid to do so.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,22,"If we stop getting paid, we will likely stop showing up—even if we love our job."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,23,"Working with Thorndike's law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific experiments on animals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through operant conditioning (Skinner, 1938)."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,70,"Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always increases a behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,71,"In contrast,  punishment  always decreases a behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,72,"In  positive punishment , you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,73,An example of positive punishment is scolding a student to get the student to stop texting in class.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,74,"In this case, a stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting in class)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,75,"In  negative punishment , you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,76,"For example, when a child misbehaves, a parent can take away a favorite toy."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,77,"In this case, a stimulus (the toy) is removed in order to decrease the behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,78,"Punishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,79,"For example, imagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, hit his younger brother."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,80,"You have Brandon write 100 times ""I will not hit my brother"" (positive punishment)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,81,Chances are he won't repeat this behavior.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,82,"While strategies like this are common today, in the past children were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,83,It's important to be aware of some of the drawbacks in using physical punishment on children.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,84,"First, punishment may teach fear."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,85,"Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become fearful of the person who delivered the punishment—you, his parent."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,86,"Similarly, children who are punished by teachers may come to fear the teacher and try to avoid school (Gershoff et al., 2010)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,87,"Consequently, most schools in the United States have banned corporal punishment."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,88,"Second, punishment may cause children to become more aggressive and prone to antisocial behavior and delinquency (Gershoff, 2002)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,89,"They see their parents resort to spanking when they become angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act out this same behavior when they become angry and frustrated."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,90,"For example, because you spank Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she might start hitting her friends when they won't share their toys."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,91,"While positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of punishment should be weighed against the possible negative effects."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,92,Today's psychologists and parenting experts favor reinforcement over punishment—they recommend that you catch your child doing something good and reward her for it.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,93,"Shaping  In his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,94,"Instead of rewarding only the target behavior, in  shaping , we reward successive approximations of a target behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,95,Why is shaping needed?
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,96,"Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first display the behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,97,Shaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display anything but the simplest of behaviors spontaneously.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,98,"In shaping, behaviors are broken down into many small, achievable steps."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,99,The specific steps used in the process are the following:                                         Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,100,Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,101,You will no longer reinforce the previously reinforced response.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,102,"Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,103,Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,104,"Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,105,Shaping is often used in teaching a complex behavior or chain of behaviors.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,106,"Skinner used shaping to teach pigeons not only such relatively simple behaviors as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also many unusual and entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and even playing ping pong; the technique is commonly used by animal trainers today."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,107,An important part of shaping is stimulus discrimination.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,108,"Recall Pavlov's dogs—he trained them to respond to the tone of a bell, and not to similar tones or sounds."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,109,This discrimination is also important in operant conditioning and in shaping behavior.

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,111,"It's easy to see how shaping is effective in teaching behaviors to animals, but how does shaping work with humans?"
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,112,Let's consider parents whose goal is to have their child learn to clean his room.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,113,They use shaping to help him master steps toward the goal.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,114,"Instead of performing the entire task, they set up these steps and reinforce each step."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,115,"First, he cleans up one toy."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,116,"Second, he cleans up five toys."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,117,"Third, he chooses whether to pick up ten toys or put his books and clothes away."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,118,"Fourth, he cleans up everything except two toys."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,122,How did the rats learn to press the lever in the Skinner box?
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,123,They were rewarded with food each time they pressed the lever.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,124,"For animals, food would be an obvious reinforcer."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,125,What would be a good reinforce for humans?
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,126,"For your daughter Sydney, it was the promise of a toy if she cleaned her room."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,127,"How about Joaquin, the soccer player?"
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,128,"If you gave Joaquin a piece of candy every time he made a goal, you would be using a  primary reinforcer ."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,129,Primary reinforcers are reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,130,These kinds of reinforcers are not learned.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,131,"Water, food, sleep, shelter, sex, and touch, among others, are primary reinforcers."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,132,Pleasure is also a primary reinforcer.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,133,Organisms do not lose their drive for these things.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,134,"For most people, jumping in a cool lake on a very hot day would be reinforcing and the cool lake would be innately reinforcing—the water would cool the person off (a physical need), as well as provide pleasure."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,135,A  secondary reinforcer  has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a primary reinforcer.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,136,"Praise, linked to affection, is one example of a secondary reinforcer, as when you called out ""Great shot!"""
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,137,every time Joaquin made a goal.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,138,"Another example, money, is only worth something when you can use it to buy other things—either things that satisfy basic needs (food, water, shelter—all primary reinforcers) or other secondary reinforcers."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,139,"If you were on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you had stacks of money, the money would not be useful if you could not spend it."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,140,What about the stickers on the behavior chart?
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,141,They also are secondary reinforcers.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,142,"Sometimes, instead of stickers on a sticker chart, a token is used."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,143,"Tokens, which are also secondary reinforcers, can then be traded in for rewards and prizes."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,144,"Entire behavior management systems, known as token economies, are built around the use of these kinds of token reinforcers."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,145,"Token economies have been found to be very effective at modifying behavior in a variety of settings such as schools, prisons, and mental hospitals."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,146,"For example, a study by Cangi and Daly (2013) found that use of a token economy increased appropriate social behaviors and reduced inappropriate behaviors in a group of autistic school children."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,147,Autistic children tend to exhibit disruptive behaviors such as pinching and hitting.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,148,"When the children in the study exhibited appropriate behavior (not hitting or pinching), they received a ""quiet hands"" token."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,149,"When they hit or pinched, they lost a token."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,156,The goal is to increase acceptable behaviors and decrease misbehavior.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,157,"Remember, it is best to reinforce desired behaviors, rather than to use punishment."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,158,"In the classroom, the teacher can reinforce a wide range of behaviors, from students raising their hands, to walking quietly in the hall, to turning in their homework."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,159,"At home, parents might create a behavior chart that rewards children for things such as putting away toys, brushing their teeth, and helping with dinner."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,160,"In order for behavior modification to be effective, the reinforcement needs to be connected with the behavior; the reinforcement must matter to the child and be done consistently."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,164,It operates on the principle of negative punishment.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,165,"When a child demonstrates an undesirable behavior, she is removed from the desirable activity at hand ( Figure 6.12 )."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,166,"For example, say that Sophia and her brother Mario are playing with building blocks."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,167,"Sophia throws some blocks at her brother, so you give her a warning that she will go to time-out if she does it again."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,168,"A few minutes later, she throws more blocks at Mario."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,169,You remove Sophia from the room for a few minutes.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,170,"When she comes back, she doesn't throw blocks."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,171,There are several important points that you should know if you plan to implement time-out as a behavior modification technique.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,172,"First, make sure the child is being removed from a desirable activity and placed in a less desirable location."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,173,"If the activity is something undesirable for the child, this technique will backfire because it is more enjoyable for the child to be removed from the activity."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,174,"Second, the length of the time-out is important."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,175,The general rule of thumb is one minute for each year of the child's age.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,176,"Sophia is five; therefore, she sits in a time-out for five minutes."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,177,Setting a timer helps children know how long they have to sit in time-out.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,178,"Finally, as a caregiver, keep several guidelines in mind over the course of a time-out: remain calm when directing your child to time-out; ignore your child during time-out (because caregiver attention may reinforce misbehavior); and give the child a hug or a kind word when time-out is over."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,181,"For example, (a) a child might be playing on the playground with friends and push another child; (b) the child who misbehaved would then be removed from the activity for a short period of time."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,182,"Reinforcement Schedules  Remember, the best way to teach a person or animal a behavior is to use positive reinforcement."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,183,"For example, Skinner used positive reinforcement to teach rats to press a lever in a Skinner box."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,184,"At first, the rat might randomly hit the lever while exploring the box, and out would come a pellet of food."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,185,"After eating the pellet, what do you think the hungry rat did next?"
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,186,"It hit the lever again, and received another pellet of food."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,187,"Each time the rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,188,"When an organism receives a reinforcer each time it displays a behavior, it is called  continuous reinforcement ."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,189,"This reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach someone a behavior, and it is especially effective in training a new behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,190,Let's look back at the dog that was learning to sit earlier in the chapter.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,191,"Now, each time he sits, you give him a treat."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,192,"Timing is important here: you will be most successful if you present the reinforcer immediately after he sits, so that he can make an association between the target behavior (sitting) and the consequence (getting a treat)."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,194,"Once a behavior is trained, researchers and trainers often turn to another type of reinforcement schedule—partial reinforcement."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,195,"In  partial reinforcement , also referred to as intermittent reinforcement, the person or animal does not get reinforced every time they perform the desired behavior."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,196,There are several different types of partial reinforcement schedules ( Table 6.3 ).
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,197,"These schedules are described as either fixed or variable, and as either interval or ratio."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,198,"Fixed  refers to the number of responses between reinforcements, or the amount of time between reinforcements, which is set and unchanging."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,199,"Variable  refers to the number of responses or amount of time between reinforcements, which varies or changes."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,200,"Interval  means the schedule is based on the time between reinforcements, and  ratio  means the schedule is based on the number of responses between reinforcements."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,206,A  fixed interval reinforcement schedule  is when behavior is rewarded after a set amount of time.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,207,"For example, June undergoes major surgery in a hospital."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,208,"During recovery, she is expected to experience pain and will require prescription medications for pain relief."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,209,June is given an IV drip with a patient-controlled painkiller.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,210,Her doctor sets a limit: one dose per hour.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,211,"June pushes a button when pain becomes difficult, and she receives a dose of medication."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,212,"Since the reward (pain relief) only occurs on a fixed interval, there is no point in exhibiting the behavior when it will not be rewarded."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,213,"With a  variable interval reinforcement schedule , the person or animal gets the reinforcement based on varying amounts of time, which are unpredictable."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,214,Say that Manuel is the manager at a fast-food restaurant.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,215,Every once in a while someone from the quality control division comes to Manuel's restaurant.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,216,"If the restaurant is clean and the service is fast, everyone on that shift earns a $20 bonus."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,217,"Manuel never knows when the quality control person will show up, so he always tries to keep the restaurant clean and ensures that his employees provide prompt and courteous service."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,218,His productivity regarding prompt service and keeping a clean restaurant are steady because he wants his crew to earn the bonus.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,219,"With a  fixed ratio reinforcement schedule , there are a set number of responses that must occur before the behavior is rewarded."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,220,"Carla sells glasses at an eyeglass store, and she earns a commission every time she sells a pair of glasses."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,221,"She always tries to sell people more pairs of glasses, including prescription sunglasses or a backup pair, so she can increase her commission."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,222,"She does not care if the person really needs the prescription sunglasses, Carla just wants her bonus."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,223,The quality of what Carla sells does not matter because her commission is not based on quality; it's only based on the number of pairs sold.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,224,This distinction in the quality of performance can help determine which reinforcement method is most appropriate for a particular situation.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,225,"Fixed ratios are better suited to optimize the quantity of output, whereas a fixed interval, in which the reward is not quantity based, can lead to a higher quality of output."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,226,"In a  variable ratio reinforcement schedule , the number of responses needed for a reward varies."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,227,This is the most powerful partial reinforcement schedule.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,228,An example of the variable ratio reinforcement schedule is gambling.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,229,"Imagine that Sarah—generally a smart, thrifty woman—visits Las Vegas for the first time."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,230,"She is not a gambler, but out of curiosity she puts a quarter into the slot machine, and then another, and another."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,231,Nothing happens.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,232,"Two dollars in quarters later, her curiosity is fading, and she is just about to quit."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,233,"But then, the machine lights up, bells go off, and Sarah gets 50 quarters back."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,234,That's more like it!
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,235,"Sarah gets back to inserting quarters with renewed interest, and a few minutes later she has used up all her gains and is $10 in the hole."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,236,Now might be a sensible time to quit.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,237,"And yet, she keeps putting money into the slot machine because she never knows when the next reinforcement is coming."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,238,"She keeps thinking that with the next quarter she could win $50, or $100, or even more."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,239,"Because the reinforcement schedule in most types of gambling has a variable ratio schedule, people keep trying and hoping that the next time they will win big."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,240,This is one of the reasons that gambling is so addictive—and so resistant to extinction.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,241,"In operant conditioning, extinction of a reinforced behavior occurs at some point after reinforcement stops, and the speed at which this happens depends on the reinforcement schedule."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,242,"In a variable ratio schedule, the point of extinction comes very slowly, as described above."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,243,"But in the other reinforcement schedules, extinction may come quickly."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,244,"For example, if June presses the button for the pain relief medication before the allotted time her doctor has approved, no medication is administered."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,245,"She is on a fixed interval reinforcement schedule (dosed hourly), so extinction occurs quickly when reinforcement doesn't come at the expected time."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,246,"Among the reinforcement schedules, variable ratio is the most productive and the most resistant to extinction."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,247,Fixed interval is the least productive and the easiest to extinguish ( Figure 6.13 ).
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,248,Figure   6.13        The four reinforcement schedules yield different response patterns.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,249,"The variable ratio schedule is unpredictable and yields high and steady response rates, with little if any pause after reinforcement (e.g., gambler)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,250,"A fixed ratio schedule is predictable and produces a high response rate, with a short pause after reinforcement (e.g., eyeglass saleswoman)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,251,"The variable interval schedule is unpredictable and produces a moderate, steady response rate (e.g., restaurant manager)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,252,"The fixed interval schedule yields a scallop-shaped response pattern, reflecting a significant pause after reinforcement (e.g., surgery patient)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,253,"Connect the Concepts     Gambling and the Brain   Skinner (1953) stated, ""If the gambling establishment cannot persuade a patron to turn over money with no return, it may achieve the same effect by returning part of the patron's money on a variable-ratio schedule"" (p. 397)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,254,Skinner uses gambling as an example of the power and effectiveness of conditioning behavior based on a variable ratio reinforcement schedule.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,255,"In fact, Skinner was so confident in his knowledge of gambling addiction that he even claimed he could turn a pigeon into a pathological gambler (""Skinner's Utopia,"" 1971)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,256,"Beyond the power of variable ratio reinforcement, gambling seems to work on the brain in the same way as some addictive drugs."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,257,The Illinois Institute for Addiction Recovery (n.d.) reports evidence suggesting that pathological gambling is an addiction similar to a chemical addiction ( Figure 6.14 ).
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,258,"Specifically, gambling may activate the reward centers of the brain, much like cocaine does."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,259,"Research has shown that some pathological gamblers have lower levels of the neurotransmitter (brain chemical) known as norepinephrine than do normal gamblers (Roy, et al., 1988)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,260,"According to a study conducted by Alec Roy and colleagues, norepinephrine is secreted when a person feels stress, arousal, or thrill; pathological gamblers use gambling to increase their levels of this neurotransmitter."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,261,"Another researcher, neuroscientist Hans Breiter, has done extensive research on gambling and its effects on the brain."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,262,"Breiter (as cited in Franzen, 2001) reports that ""Monetary reward in a gambling-like experiment produces brain activation very similar to that observed in a cocaine addict receiving an infusion of cocaine"" (para."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,264,"Deficiencies in serotonin (another neurotransmitter) might also contribute to compulsive behavior, including a gambling addiction."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,265,"It may be that pathological gamblers' brains are different than those of other people, and perhaps this difference may somehow have led to their gambling addiction, as these studies seem to suggest."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,266,"However, it is very difficult to ascertain the cause because it is impossible to conduct a true experiment (it would be unethical to try to turn randomly assigned participants into problem gamblers)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,267,"Therefore, it may be that causation actually moves in the opposite direction—perhaps the act of gambling somehow changes neurotransmitter levels in some gamblers' brains."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,268,"It also is possible that some overlooked factor, or confounding variable, played a role in both the gambling addiction and the differences in brain chemistry."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,271,"Tolman's experiments with rats demonstrated that organisms can learn even if they do not receive immediate reinforcement (Tolman &amp; Honzik, 1930; Tolman, Ritchie, &amp; Kalish, 1946)."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,272,"This finding was in conflict with the prevailing idea at the time that reinforcement must be immediate in order for learning to occur, thus suggesting a cognitive aspect to learning."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,273,"In the experiments, Tolman placed hungry rats in a maze with no reward for finding their way through it."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,275,"As the unreinforced rats explored the maze, they developed a  cognitive map : a mental picture of the layout of the maze ( Figure 6.15 )."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,276,"After 10 sessions in the maze without reinforcement, food was placed in a goal box at the end of the maze."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,277,"As soon as the rats became aware of the food, they were able to find their way through the maze quickly, just as quickly as the comparison group, which had been rewarded with food all along."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,278,This is known as  latent learning : learning that occurs but is not observable in behavior until there is a reason to demonstrate it.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,279,Figure   6.15        Psychologist Edward Tolman found that rats use cognitive maps to navigate through a maze.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,280,Have you ever worked your way through various levels on a video game?
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,281,"You learned when to turn left or right, move up or down."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,282,"In that case you were relying on a cognitive map, just like the rats in a maze."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,283,Latent learning also occurs in humans.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,284,"Children may learn by watching the actions of their parents but only demonstrate it at a later date, when the learned material is needed."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,285,"For example, suppose that Ravi's dad drives him to school every day."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,286,"In this way, Ravi learns the route from his house to his school, but he's never driven there himself, so he has not had a chance to demonstrate that he's learned the way."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,287,"One morning Ravi's dad has to leave early for a meeting, so he can't drive Ravi to school."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,288,"Instead, Ravi follows the same route on his bike that his dad would have taken in the car."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,289,This demonstrates latent learning.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,290,"Ravi had learned the route to school, but had no need to demonstrate this knowledge earlier."

af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,292,"While that can be frustrating, you're not alone."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,293,"At one time or another we've all gotten lost in places like a museum, hospital, or university library."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,294,"Whenever we go someplace new, we build a mental representation—or cognitive map—of the location, as Tolman's rats built a cognitive map of their maze."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,295,"However, some buildings are confusing because they include many areas that look alike or have short lines of sight."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,296,"Because of this, it's often difficult to predict what's around a corner or decide whether to turn left or right to get out of a building."
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,297,Psychologist Laura Carlson (2010) suggests that what we place in our cognitive map can impact our success in navigating through the environment.
af8ef404-215b-4421-a5f7-88343e2129d8@15,6,4,Operant Conditioning,298,"She suggests that paying attention to specific features upon entering a building, such as a picture on the wall, a fountain, a statue, or an escalator, adds information to our cognitive map that can be used later to help find our way out of the building."

b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,2,"In  observational learning , we learn by watching others and then imitating, or modeling, what they do or say."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,3,The individuals performing the imitated behavior are called  models .
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,4,"Research suggests that this imitative learning involves a specific type of neuron, called a mirror neuron (Hickock, 2010; Rizzolatti, Fadiga, Fogassi, &amp; Gallese, 2002; Rizzolatti, Fogassi, &amp; Gallese, 2006)."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,5,Humans and other animals are capable of observational learning.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,6,"As you will see, the phrase ""monkey see, monkey do"" really is accurate ( Figure 6.16 )."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,7,The same could be said about other animals.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,8,"For example, in a study of social learning in chimpanzees, researchers gave juice boxes with straws to two groups of captive chimpanzees."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,9,"The first group dipped the straw into the juice box, and then sucked on the small amount of juice at the end of the straw."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,10,"The second group sucked through the straw directly, getting much more juice."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,11,"When the first group, the ""dippers,"" observed the second group, ""the suckers,"" what do you think happened?"
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,12,"All of the ""dippers"" in the first group switched to sucking through the straws directly."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,13,"By simply observing the other chimps and modeling their behavior, they learned that this was a more efficient method of getting juice (Yamamoto, Humle, and Tanaka, 2013)."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,14,Figure   6.16        This spider monkey learned to drink water from a plastic bottle by seeing the behavior modeled by a human.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,15,"Imitation is much more obvious in humans, but is  imitation  really the sincerest form of flattery?"
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,16,Consider Claire's experience with observational learning.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,17,"Claire's nine-year-old son, Jay, was getting into trouble at school and was defiant at home."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,18,"Claire feared that Jay would end up like her brothers, two of whom were in prison."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,19,"One day, after yet another bad day at school and another negative note from the teacher, Claire, at her wit's end, beat her son with a belt to get him to behave."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,20,"Later that night, as she put her children to bed, Claire witnessed her four-year-old daughter, Anna, take a belt to her teddy bear and whip it."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,21,"Claire was horrified, realizing that Anna was imitating her mother."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,22,It was then that Claire knew she wanted to discipline her children in a different manner.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,23,"Like Tolman, whose experiments with rats suggested a cognitive component to learning, psychologist Albert Bandura's ideas about learning were different from those of strict behaviorists."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,24,"Bandura and other researchers proposed a brand of behaviorism called social learning theory, which took cognitive processes into account."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,25,"According to  Bandura , pure behaviorism could not explain why learning can take place in the absence of external reinforcement."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,26,He felt that internal mental states must also have a role in learning and that observational learning involves much more than imitation.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,27,"In imitation, a person simply copies what the model does."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,28,Observational learning is much more complex.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,29,According to Lefrançois (2012) there are several ways that observational learning can occur:            You learn a new response.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,30,"After watching your coworker get chewed out by your boss for coming in late, you start leaving home 10 minutes earlier so that you won't be late."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,31,You choose whether or not to imitate the model depending on what you saw happen to the model.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,32,Remember Julian and his father?
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,33,"When learning to surf, Julian might watch how his father pops up successfully on his surfboard and then attempt to do the same thing."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,34,"On the other hand, Julian might learn not to touch a hot stove after watching his father get burned on a stove."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,35,You learn a general rule that you can apply to other situations.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,36,"Bandura identified three kinds of models: live, verbal, and symbolic."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,37,"A live model demonstrates a behavior in person, as when Ben stood up on his surfboard so that Julian could see how he did it."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,38,"A verbal instructional model does not perform the behavior, but instead explains or describes the behavior, as when a soccer coach tells his young players to kick the ball with the side of the foot, not with the toe."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,39,"A symbolic model can be fictional characters or real people who demonstrate behaviors in books, movies, television shows, video games, or Internet sources ( Figure 6.17 )."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,40,Figure   6.17        (a) Yoga students learn by observation as their yoga instructor demonstrates the correct stance and movement for her students (live model).
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,41,"b) Models don't have to be present for learning to occur: through symbolic modeling, this child can learn a behavior by watching someone demonstrate it on television."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,42,Link to Learning     Latent learning and modeling are used all the time in the world of marketing and advertising.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,43,"This commercial  played for months across the New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut areas, Derek Jeter, an award-winning baseball player for the New York Yankees, is advertising a Ford."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,44,The commercial aired in a part of the country where Jeter is an incredibly well-known athlete.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,45,"He is wealthy, and considered very loyal and good looking."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,46,What message are the advertisers sending by having him featured in the ad?
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,47,How effective do you think it is?
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,48,"Steps in the Modeling Process               Of course, we don't learn a behavior simply by observing a model."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,49,"Bandura described specific steps in the process of modeling that must be followed if learning is to be successful: attention, retention, reproduction, and motivation."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,50,"First, you must be focused on what the model is doing—you have to pay attention."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,51,"Next, you must be able to retain, or remember, what you observed; this is retention."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,52,"Then, you must be able to perform the behavior that you observed and committed to memory; this is reproduction."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,53,"Finally, you must have motivation."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,54,"You need to want to copy the behavior, and whether or not you are motivated depends on what happened to the model."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,55,"If you saw that the model was reinforced for her behavior, you will be more motivated to copy her."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,56,This is known as  vicarious reinforcement .
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,57,"On the other hand, if you observed the model being punished, you would be less motivated to copy her."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,58,This is called  vicarious punishment .
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,59,"For example, imagine that four-year-old Allison watched her older sister Kaitlyn playing in their mother's makeup, and then saw Kaitlyn get a time out when their mother came in."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,60,"After their mother left the room, Allison was tempted to play in the make-up, but she did not want to get a time-out from her mother."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,61,What do you think she did?
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,62,"Once you actually demonstrate the new behavior, the reinforcement you receive plays a part in whether or not you will repeat the behavior."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,63,"Bandura researched modeling behavior, particularly children's modeling of adults' aggressive and violent behaviors (Bandura, Ross, &amp; Ross, 1961)."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,64,He conducted an experiment with a five-foot inflatable doll that he called a Bobo doll.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,65,"In the experiment, children's aggressive behavior was influenced by whether the teacher was punished for her behavior."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,66,"In one scenario, a teacher acted aggressively with the doll, hitting, throwing, and even punching the doll, while a child watched."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,67,There were two types of responses by the children to the teacher's behavior.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,68,"When the teacher was punished for her bad behavior, the children decreased their tendency to act as she had."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,69,"When the teacher was praised or ignored (and not punished for her behavior), the children imitated what she did, and even what she said."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,70,"They punched, kicked, and yelled at the doll."

b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,72,What are the implications of this study?
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,73,"Bandura concluded that we watch and learn, and that this learning can have both  prosocial  and  antisocial  effects."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,74,Prosocial (positive) models can be used to encourage socially acceptable behavior.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,75,Parents in particular should take note of this finding.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,76,"If you want your children to read, then read to them."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,77,Let them see you reading.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,78,Keep books in your home.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,79,Talk about your favorite books.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,80,"If you want your children to be healthy, then let them see you eat right and exercise, and spend time engaging in physical fitness activities together."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,81,"The same holds true for qualities like kindness, courtesy, and honesty."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,82,"The main idea is that children observe and learn from their parents, even their parents' morals, so be consistent and toss out the old adage ""Do as I say, not as I do,"" because children tend to copy what you do instead of what you say."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,83,"Besides parents, many public figures, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, are viewed as prosocial models who are able to inspire global social change."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,84,Can you think of someone who has been a prosocial model in your life?
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,85,The antisocial effects of observational learning are also worth mentioning.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,86,"As you saw from the example of Claire at the beginning of this section, her daughter viewed Claire's aggressive behavior and copied it."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,87,"Research suggests that this may help to explain why abused children often grow up to be abusers themselves (Murrell, Christoff, &amp; Henning, 2007)."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,88,"In fact, about 30% of abused children become abusive parents (U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, 2013)."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,89,We tend to do what we know.
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,90,"Abused children, who grow up witnessing their parents deal with anger and frustration through violent and aggressive acts, often learn to behave in that manner themselves."

b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,94,"These findings may not be surprising, given that a child graduating from high school has been exposed to around 200,000 violent acts including murder, robbery, torture, bombings, beatings, and rape through various forms of media (Huston et al., 1992)."
b5043fe6-b461-4abb-b9ec-8d5de2bb50d8@11,6,5,,95,"Not only might viewing media violence affect aggressive behavior by teaching people to act that way in real life situations, but it has also been suggested that repeated exposure to violent acts also desensitizes people to it."

bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,62,"An  artificial concept , on the other hand, is a concept that is defined by a specific set of characteristics."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,63,"Various properties of geometric shapes, like squares and triangles, serve as useful examples of artificial concepts."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,64,A triangle always has three angles and three sides.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,65,A square always has four equal sides and four right angles.

bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,67,Artificial concepts can enhance the understanding of a topic by building on one another.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,68,"For example, before learning the concept of ""area of a square"" (and the formula to find it), you must understand what a square is."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,69,"Once the concept of ""area of a square"" is understood, an understanding of area for other geometric shapes can be built upon the original understanding of area."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,70,The use of artificial concepts to define an idea is crucial to communicating with others and engaging in complex thought.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,71,"According to Goldstone and Kersten (2003), concepts act as building blocks and can be connected in countless combinations to create complex thoughts."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,72,"Schemata    A  schema  is a mental construct consisting of a cluster or collection of related concepts (Bartlett, 1932)."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,73,"There are many different types of schemata, and they all have one thing in common: schemata are a method of organizing information that allows the brain to work more efficiently."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,74,"When a schema is activated, the brain makes immediate assumptions about the person or object being observed."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,75,There are several types of schemata.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,76,"A  role schema  makes assumptions about how individuals in certain roles will behave (Callero, 1994)."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,77,"For example, imagine you meet someone who introduces himself as a firefighter."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,78,"When this happens, your brain automatically activates the ""firefighter schema"" and begins making assumptions that this person is brave, selfless, and community-oriented."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,79,"Despite not knowing this person, already you have unknowingly made judgments about him."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,80,Schemata also help you fill in gaps in the information you receive from the world around you.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,81,"While schemata allow for more efficient information processing, there can be problems with schemata, regardless of whether they are accurate: Perhaps this particular firefighter is not brave, he just works as a firefighter to pay the bills while studying to become a children's librarian."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,82,"An  event schema , also known as a  cognitive script , is a set of behaviors that can feel like a routine."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,83,Think about what you do when you walk into an elevator ( Figure 7.5 ).
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,84,"First, the doors open and you wait to let exiting passengers leave the elevator car."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,85,"Then, you step into the elevator and turn around to face the doors, looking for the correct button to push."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,86,"You never face the back of the elevator, do you?"
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,87,"And when you're riding in a crowded elevator and you can't face the front, it feels uncomfortable, doesn't it?"
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,88,"Interestingly, event schemata can vary widely among different cultures and countries."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,89,"For example, while it is quite common for people to greet one another with a handshake in the United States, in Tibet, you greet someone by sticking your tongue out at them, and in Belize, you bump fists (Cairns Regional Council, n.d.)               Figure   7.5        What event schema do you perform when riding in an elevator?"
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,90,"Because event schemata are automatic, they can be difficult to change."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,91,Imagine that you are driving home from work or school.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,92,"This event schema involves getting in the car, shutting the door, and buckling your seatbelt before putting the key in the ignition."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,93,You might perform this script two or three times each day.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,94,"As you drive home, you hear your phone's ring tone."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,95,"Typically, the event schema that occurs when you hear your phone ringing involves locating the phone and answering it or responding to your latest text message."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,96,"So without thinking, you reach for your phone, which could be in your pocket, in your bag, or on the passenger seat of the car."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,97,This powerful event schema is informed by your pattern of behavior and the pleasurable stimulation that a phone call or text message gives your brain.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,98,"Because it is a schema, it is extremely challenging for us to stop reaching for the phone, even though we know that we endanger our own lives and the lives of others while we do it (Neyfakh, 2013) ( Figure 7.6 )."

bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,101,It feels almost impossible to walk in and  not  face the door.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,102,"Our powerful event schema dictates our behavior in the elevator, and it is no different with our phones."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,103,"Current research suggests that it is the habit, or event schema, of checking our phones in many different situations that makes refraining from checking them while driving especially difficult (Bayer &amp; Campbell, 2012)."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,104,"Because texting and driving has become a dangerous epidemic in recent years, psychologists are looking at ways to help people interrupt the ""phone schema"" while driving."
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,105,Event schemata like these are the reason why many habits are difficult to break once they have been acquired.
bbc32517-1050-4d66-bba3-97ba982c6e60@16,7,2,,106,"As we continue to examine thinking, keep in mind how powerful the forces of concepts and schemata are to our understanding of the world."

f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,2,"While language is a form of communication, not all communication is language."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,3,"Many species communicate with one another through their postures, movements, odors, or vocalizations."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,4,This communication is crucial for species that need to interact and develop social relationships with their conspecifics.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,5,"However, many people have asserted that it is language that makes humans unique among all of the animal species (Corballis &amp; Suddendorf, 2007; Tomasello &amp; Rakoczy, 2003)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,6,"This section will focus on what distinguishes language as a special form of communication, how the use of language develops, and how language affects the way we think."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,7,"Components of Language   Language, be it spoken, signed, or written, has specific components: a lexicon and grammar."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,8,Lexicon  refers to the words of a given language.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,9,"Thus, lexicon is a language's vocabulary."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,10,"Grammar  refers to the set of rules that are used to convey meaning through the use of the lexicon (Fernández &amp; Cairns, 2011)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,11,"For instance, English grammar dictates that most verbs receive an ""-ed"" at the end to indicate past tense."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,12,Words are formed by combining the various phonemes that make up the language.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,13,"A  phoneme  (e.g., the sounds ""ah"" vs. ""eh"") is a basic sound unit of a given language, and different languages have different sets of phonemes."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,14,"Phonemes are combined to form  morphemes , which are the smallest units of language that convey some type of meaning (e.g., ""I"" is both a phoneme and a morpheme)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,15,We use semantics and syntax to construct language.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,16,Semantics and syntax are part of a language's grammar.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,17,Semantics  refers to the process by which we derive meaning from morphemes and words.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,18,"Syntax  refers to the way words are organized into sentences (Chomsky, 1965; Fernández &amp; Cairns, 2011)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,19,"We apply the rules of grammar to organize the lexicon in novel and creative ways, which allow us to communicate information about both concrete and abstract concepts."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,20,We can talk about our immediate and observable surroundings as well as the surface of unseen planets.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,21,"We can share our innermost thoughts, our plans for the future, and debate the value of a college education."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,22,"We can provide detailed instructions for cooking a meal, fixing a car, or building a fire."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,23,The flexibility that language provides to relay vastly different types of information is a property that makes language so distinct as a mode of communication among humans.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,24,"Language Development   Given the remarkable complexity of a language, one might expect that mastering a language would be an especially arduous task; indeed, for those of us trying to learn a second language as adults, this might seem to be true."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,25,"However, young children master language very quickly with relative ease."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,26,B. F.  Skinner  (1957) proposed that language is learned through reinforcement.

f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,28,The use of language develops in the absence of formal instruction and appears to follow a very similar pattern in children from vastly different cultures and backgrounds.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,29,"It would seem, therefore, that we are born with a biological predisposition to acquire a language (Chomsky, 1965; Fernández &amp; Cairns, 2011)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,30,"Moreover, it appears that there is a critical period for language acquisition, such that this proficiency at acquiring language is maximal early in life; generally, as people age, the ease with which they acquire and master new languages diminishes (Johnson &amp; Newport, 1989; Lenneberg, 1967; Singleton, 1995)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,31,Children begin to learn about language from a very early age ( Table 7.1 ).
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,32,"In fact, it appears that this is occurring even before we are born."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,33,Newborns show preference for their mother's voice and appear to be able to discriminate between the language spoken by their mother and other languages.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,34,"Babies are also attuned to the languages being used around them and show preferences for videos of faces that are moving in synchrony with the audio of spoken language versus videos that do not synchronize with the audio (Blossom &amp; Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke &amp; Cortelyou, 1981)."

f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,36,"The girl, who came to be known as Genie, had lived most of her life tied to a potty chair or confined to a crib in a small room that was kept closed with the curtains drawn."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,37,"For a little over a decade, Genie had virtually no social interaction and no access to the outside world."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,38,"As a result of these conditions, Genie was unable to stand up, chew solid food, or speak (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, &amp; Rigler, 1974; Rymer, 1993)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,39,The police took Genie into protective custody.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,40,"Genie's abilities improved dramatically following her removal from her abusive environment, and early on, it appeared she was acquiring language—much later than would be predicted by critical period hypotheses that had been posited at the time (Fromkin et al., 1974)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,41,Genie managed to amass an impressive vocabulary in a relatively short amount of time.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,42,"However, she never developed a mastery of the grammatical aspects of language (Curtiss, 1981)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,43,Perhaps being deprived of the opportunity to learn language during a critical period impeded Genie's ability to fully acquire and use language.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,44,"You may recall that each language has its own set of phonemes that are used to generate morphemes, words, and so on."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,45,"Babies can discriminate among the sounds that make up a language (for example, they can tell the difference between the ""s"" in vision and the ""ss"" in fission); early on, they can differentiate between the sounds of all human languages, even those that do not occur in the languages that are used in their environments."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,46,"However, by the time that they are about 1 year old, they can only discriminate among those phonemes that are used in the language or languages in their environments (Jensen, 2011; Werker &amp; Lalonde, 1988; Werker &amp; Tees, 1984)."

f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,48,"After the first few months of life, babies enter what is known as the babbling stage, during which time they tend to produce single syllables that are repeated over and over."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,49,"As time passes, more variations appear in the syllables that they produce."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,50,"During this time, it is unlikely that the babies are trying to communicate; they are just as likely to babble when they are alone as when they are with their caregivers (Fernández &amp; Cairns, 2011)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,51,"Interestingly, babies who are raised in environments in which sign language is used will also begin to show babbling in the gestures of their hands during this stage (Petitto, Holowka, Sergio, Levy, &amp; Ostry, 2004)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,52,"Generally, a child's first word is uttered sometime between the ages of 1 year to 18 months, and for the next few months, the child will remain in the ""one word"" stage of language development."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,53,"During this time, children know a number of words, but they only produce one-word utterances."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,54,"The child's early vocabulary is limited to familiar objects or events, often nouns."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,55,"Although children in this stage only make one-word utterances, these words often carry larger meaning (Fernández &amp; Cairns, 2011)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,56,"So, for example, a child saying ""cookie"" could be identifying a cookie or asking for a cookie."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,57,"As a child's lexicon grows, she begins to utter simple sentences and to acquire new vocabulary at a very rapid pace."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,58,"In addition, children begin to demonstrate a clear understanding of the specific rules that apply to their language(s)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,59,Even the mistakes that children sometimes make provide evidence of just how much they understand about those rules.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,60,This is sometimes seen in the form of  overgeneralization .
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,61,"In this context, overgeneralization refers to an extension of a language rule to an exception to the rule."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,62,"For example, in English, it is usually the case that an ""s"" is added to the end of a word to indicate plurality."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,63,"For example, we speak of one dog versus two dogs."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,64,"Young children will overgeneralize this rule to cases that are exceptions to the ""add an s to the end of the word"" rule and say things like ""those two gooses"" or ""three mouses."""
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,65,"Clearly, the rules of the language are understood, even if the exceptions to the rules are still being learned (Moskowitz, 1978)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,66,"Language and Thought    When we speak one language, we agree that words are representations of ideas, people, places, and events."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,67,The given language that children learn is connected to their culture and surroundings.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,68,But can words themselves shape the way we think about things?
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,69,"Psychologists have long investigated the question of whether language shapes thoughts and actions, or whether our thoughts and beliefs shape our language."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,70,"Two researchers, Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, began this investigation in the 1940s."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,71,"They wanted to understand how the language habits of a community encourage members of that community to interpret language in a particular manner (Sapir, 1941/1964)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,72,"Sapir and Whorf proposed that language determines thought, suggesting, for example, that a person whose community language did not have past-tense verbs would be challenged to think about the past (Whorf, 1956)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,73,"Researchers have since identified this view as too absolute, pointing out a lack of empiricism behind what Sapir and Whorf proposed (Abler, 2013; Boroditsky, 2011; van Troyer, 1994)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,74,"Today, psychologists continue to study and debate the relationship between language and thought."

f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,76,The Meaning of Language   Think about what you know of other languages; perhaps you even speak multiple languages.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,77,Imagine for a moment that your closest friend fluently speaks more than one language.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,78,"Do you think that friend thinks differently, depending on which language is being spoken?"
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,79,You may know a few words that are not translatable from their original language into English.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,80,"For example, the Portuguese word  saudade  originated during the 15th century, when Portuguese sailors left home to explore the seas and travel to Africa or Asia."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,81,Those left behind described the emptiness and fondness they felt as  saudade  ( Figure 7.7 ) .
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,82,"The word came to express many meanings, including loss, nostalgia, yearning, warm memories, and hope."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,83,There is no single word in English that includes all of those emotions in a single description.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,84,Do words such as  saudade  indicate that different languages produce different patterns of thought in people?
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,85,What do you think??
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,86,Figure   7.7        These two works of art depict  saudade .
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,87,"a)  Saudade de Nápoles , which is translated into ""missing Naples,"" was painted by Bertha Worms in 1895."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,88,b) Almeida Júnior painted  Saudade  in 1899.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,89,"Language may indeed influence the way that we think, an idea known as linguistic determinism."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,90,One recent demonstration of this phenomenon involved differences in the way that English and Mandarin Chinese speakers talk and think about time.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,91,"English speakers tend to talk about time using terms that describe changes along a horizontal dimension, for example, saying something like ""I'm running behind schedule"" or ""Don't get ahead of yourself."""
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,92,"While Mandarin Chinese speakers also describe time in horizontal terms, it is not uncommon to also use terms associated with a vertical arrangement."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,93,"For example, the past might be described as being ""up"" and the future as being ""down."""
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,94,It turns out that these differences in language translate into differences in performance on cognitive tests designed to measure how quickly an individual can recognize temporal relationships.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,95,"Specifically, when given a series of tasks with vertical priming, Mandarin Chinese speakers were faster at recognizing temporal relationships between months."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,96,"Indeed, Boroditsky (2001) sees these results as suggesting that ""habits in language encourage habits in thought"" (p. 12)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,97,One group of researchers who wanted to investigate how language influences thought compared how English speakers and the Dani people of Papua New Guinea think and speak about color.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,98,The Dani have two words for color: one word for  light  and one word for  dark .
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,99,"In contrast, the English language has 11 color words."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,100,Researchers hypothesized that the number of color terms could limit the ways that the Dani people conceptualized color.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,101,"However, the Dani were able to distinguish colors with the same ability as English speakers, despite having fewer words at their disposal (Berlin &amp; Kay, 1969)."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,102,"A recent review of research aimed at determining how language might affect something like color perception suggests that language can influence perceptual phenomena, especially in the left hemisphere of the brain."
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,103,You may recall from earlier chapters that the left hemisphere is associated with language for most people.
f05e92ad-77c6-4ce5-b040-bcb5afc198ce@11,7,3,Language,104,"However, the right (less linguistic hemisphere) of the brain is less affected by linguistic influences on perception (Regier &amp; Kay, 2009)"

96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,23,The way that researchers have defined the concept of intelligence has been modified many times since the birth of psychology.
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,24,"British psychologist Charles Spearman believed intelligence consisted of one general factor, called  g , which could be measured and compared among individuals."
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,25,Spearman focused on the commonalities among various intellectual abilities and demphasized what made each unique.
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,26,"Long before modern psychology developed, however, ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle, held a similar view (Cianciolo &amp; Sternberg, 2004)."
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,27,"Others psychologists believe that instead of a single factor, intelligence is a collection of distinct abilities."
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,28,"In the 1940s, Raymond Cattell proposed a theory of intelligence that divided general intelligence into two components: crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence (Cattell, 1963)."
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,29,Crystallized intelligence  is characterized as acquired knowledge and the ability to retrieve it.
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,30,"When you learn, remember, and recall information, you are using crystallized intelligence."

96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,56,The student who crawled through the window demonstrated some creative intelligence but did not use common sense.
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,57,She would have low practical intelligence.

96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,65,Creative intelligence  is marked by inventing or imagining a solution to a problem or situation.
96558f8b-6735-4b2f-9572-66c0d2c68a6d@12,7,5,,66,Creativity in this realm can include finding a novel solution to an unexpected problem or producing a beautiful work of art or a well-developed short story.

f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,14,The IQ test has been synonymous with intelligence for over a century.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,15,"In the late 1800s, Sir Francis Galton developed the first broad test of intelligence (Flanagan &amp; Kaufman, 2004)."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,16,"Although he was not a psychologist, his contributions to the concepts of intelligence testing are still felt today (Gordon, 1995)."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,17,Reliable intelligence testing (you may recall from earlier chapters that reliability refers to a test's ability to produce consistent results) began in earnest during the early 1900s with a researcher named Alfred Binet ( Figure 7.13 ).
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,18,Binet was asked by the French government to develop an intelligence test to use on children to determine which ones might have difficulty in school; it included many verbally based tasks.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,19,American researchers soon realized the value of such testing.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,20,"Louis Terman, a Stanford professor, modified Binet's work by standardizing the administration of the test and tested thousands of different-aged children to establish an average score for each age."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,21,"As a result, the test was normed and standardized, which means that the test was administered consistently to a large enough representative sample of the population that the range of scores resulted in a bell curve (bell curves will be discussed later)."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,22,"Standardization  means that the manner of administration, scoring, and interpretation of results is consistent."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,23,"Norming  involves giving a test to a large population so data can be collected comparing groups, such as age groups."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,24,"The resulting data provide norms, or referential scores, by which to interpret future scores."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,25,Norms are not expectations of what a given group  should  know but a demonstration of what that group  does  know.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,26,Norming and standardizing the test ensures that new scores are reliable.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,27,"This new version of the test was called the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale (Terman, 1916)."

f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,33,Wechsler combined several subtests from other intelligence tests used between 1880 and World War I.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,34,"These subtests tapped into a variety of verbal and nonverbal skills, because Wechsler believed that intelligence encompassed ""the global capacity of a person to act purposefully, to think rationally, and to deal effectively with his environment"" (Wechsler, 1958, p. 7)."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,35,"He named the test the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1981)."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,36,This combination of subtests became one of the most extensively used intelligence tests in the history of psychology.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,37,"Although its name was later changed to the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and has been revised several times, the aims of the test remain virtually unchanged since its inception (Boake, 2002)."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,38,"Today, there are three intelligence tests credited to Wechsler, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-fourth edition (WAIS-IV), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), and the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—IV (WPPSI-IV) (Wechsler, 2012)."
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,39,"These tests are used widely in schools and communities throughout the United States, and they are periodically normed and standardized as a means of recalibration."

f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,42,"Flynn himself argues, however, that increased IQ scores do not necessarily mean that younger generations are more intelligent per se (Flynn, Shaughnessy, &amp; Fulgham, 2012)."

f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,44,"The WISC-V is composed of 14 subtests, which comprise five indices, which then render an IQ score."

f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,47,The method of scoring reflects the understanding that intelligence is comprised of multiple abilities in several cognitive realms and focuses on the mental processes that the child used to arrive at his or her answers to each test item.
f22c928e-aaa2-4a1c-8c4a-138650d11fda@15,7,6,Measures of Intelligence,48,"Ultimately, we are still left with the question of how valid intelligence tests are."

f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,12,"This is known as  automatic processing , or the encoding of details like time, space, frequency, and the meaning of words."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,13,Automatic processing is usually done without any conscious awareness.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,14,Recalling the last time you studied for a test is another example of automatic processing.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,15,But what about the actual test material you studied?
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,16,It probably required a lot of work and attention on your part in order to encode that information.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,17,This is known as  effortful processing  ( Figure 8.3 ).
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,18,"Figure   8.3        When you first learn new skills such as driving a car, you have to put forth effort and attention to encode information about how to start a car, how to brake, how to handle a turn, and so on."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,19,"Once you know how to drive, you can encode additional information about this skill automatically."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,20,What are the most effective ways to ensure that important memories are well encoded?
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,21,"Even a simple sentence is easier to recall when it is meaningful (Anderson, 1984)."

f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,23,The notes were sour because the seams split.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,24,The voyage wasn't delayed because the bottle shattered.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,25,The haystack was important because the cloth ripped.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,26,How well did you do?
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,27,"By themselves, the statements that you wrote down were most likely confusing and difficult for you to recall."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,28,"Now, try writing them again, using the following prompts: bagpipe, ship christening, and parachutist."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,29,"Next count backwards from 40 by fours, then check yourself to see how well you recalled the sentences this time."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,30,You can see that the sentences are now much more memorable because each of the sentences was placed in context.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,31,Material is far better encoded when you make it meaningful.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,32,There are three types of encoding.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,33,The encoding of words and their meaning is known as  semantic encoding .
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,34,It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment in which he asked people to memorize words.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,35,"The 60 words were actually divided into 4 categories of meaning, although the participants did not know this because the words were randomly presented."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,36,"When they were asked to remember the words, they tended to recall them in categories, showing that they paid attention to the meanings of the words as they learned them."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,37,"Visual encoding  is the encoding of images, and  acoustic encoding  is the encoding of sounds, words in particular."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,38,"To see how visual encoding works, read over this list of words:  car, level, dog, truth, book, value ."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,39,"If you were asked later to recall the words from this list, which ones do you think you'd most likely remember?"
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,40,"You would probably have an easier time recalling the words  car, dog,  and  book , and a more difficult time recalling the words  level, truth,  and  value ."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,41,Why is this?
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,42,Because you can recall images (mental pictures) more easily than words alone.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,43,"When you read the words  car, dog,  and  book  you created images of these things in your mind."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,44,"These are concrete, high-imagery words."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,45,"On the other hand, abstract words like  level, truth,  and  value  are low-imagery words."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,46,"High-imagery words are encoded both visually and semantically (Paivio, 1986), thus building a stronger memory."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,47,Now let's turn our attention to acoustic encoding.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,48,"You are driving in your car and a song comes on the radio that you haven't heard in at least 10 years, but you sing along, recalling every word."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,49,"In the United States, children often learn the alphabet through song, and they learn the number of days in each month through rhyme:  "" Thirty days hath September, / April, June, and November; / All the rest have thirty-one, / Save February, with twenty-eight days clear, / And twenty-nine each leap year."""
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,50,These lessons are easy to remember because of acoustic encoding.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,51,We encode the sounds the words make.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,52,"This is one of the reasons why much of what we teach young children is done through song, rhyme, and rhythm."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,53,Which of the three types of encoding do you think would give you the best memory of verbal information?
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,54,"Some years ago, psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments to find out."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,55,Participants were given words along with questions about them.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,56,The questions required the participants to process the words at one of the three levels.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,57,The visual processing questions included such things as asking the participants about the font of the letters.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,58,"The acoustic processing questions asked the participants about the sound or rhyming of the words, and the semantic processing questions asked the participants about the meaning of the words."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,59,"After participants were presented with the words and questions, they were given an unexpected recall or recognition task."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,60,Words that had been encoded semantically were better remembered than those encoded visually or acoustically.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,61,Semantic encoding involves a deeper level of processing than the shallower visual or acoustic encoding.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,62,"Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding, especially if we apply what is called the self-reference effect."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,63,"The  self-reference effect  is the tendency for an individual to have better memory for information that relates to oneself in comparison to material that has less personal relevance (Rogers, Kuiper &amp; Kirker, 1977)."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,64,Could semantic encoding be beneficial to you as you attempt to memorize the concepts in this chapter?
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,65,"Storage           Once the information has been encoded, we have to somehow retain it."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,66,Our brains take the encoded information and place it in storage.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,67,Storage  is the creation of a permanent record of information.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,68,"In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass through three distinct stages:  Sensory Memory ,  Short-Term Memory , and finally  Long-Term Memory ."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,69,These stages were first proposed by Richard  Atkinson  and Richard  Shiffrin  (1968).
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,70,"Their model of human memory ( Figure 8.4 ), called Atkinson-Shiffrin (A-S), is based on the belief that we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,71,"Figure   8.4        According to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory, information passes through three distinct stages in order for it to be stored in long-term memory."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,72,But A-S is just one model of memory.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,73,"Others, such as Baddeley and Hitch (1974), have proposed a model where short-term memory itself has different forms."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,74,"In this model, storing memories in short-term memory is like opening different files on a computer and adding information."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,75,The type of short-term memory (or computer file) depends on the type of information received.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,76,"There are memories in visual-spatial form, as well as memories of spoken or written material, and they are stored in three short-term systems: a visuospatial sketchpad, an episodic buffer, and a phonological loop."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,77,"According to Baddeley and Hitch, a central executive part of memory supervises or controls the flow of information to and from the three short-term systems."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,78,"Sensory Memory               In the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, stimuli from the environment are processed first in  sensory memory : storage of brief sensory events, such as sights, sounds, and tastes."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,79,It is very brief storage—up to a couple of seconds.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,80,We are constantly bombarded with sensory information.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,81,"We cannot absorb all of it, or even most of it."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,82,And most of it has no impact on our lives.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,83,"For example, what was your professor wearing the last class period?"
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,84,"As long as the professor was dressed appropriately, it does not really matter what she was wearing."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,85,"Sensory information about sights, sounds, smells, and even textures, which we do not view as valuable information, we discard."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,86,"If we view something as valuable, the information will move into our short-term memory system."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,87,One study of sensory memory researched the significance of valuable information on short-term memory storage.
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,88,"J. R. Stroop discovered a memory phenomenon in the 1930s: you will name a color more easily if it appears printed in that color, which is called the  Stroop effect ."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,89,"In other words, the word ""red"" will be named more quickly, regardless of the color the word appears in, than any word that is colored red."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,90,Try an experiment: name the colors of the words you are given in  Figure 8.5 .
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,91,"Do not read the words, but say the color the word is printed in."
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,92,"For example, upon seeing the word ""yellow"" in green print, you should say ""green,"" not ""yellow."""
f91c2a41-6ced-4dcd-bb16-929020b9db27@17,8,2,How Memory Functions,93,"This experiment is fun, but it's not as easy as it seems."

939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,1,8.1     How Memory Functions   Memory is a system or process that stores what we learn for future use.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,2,"Our memory has three basic functions: encoding, storing, and retrieving information."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,3,Encoding is the act of getting information into our memory system through automatic or effortful processing.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,4,"Storage is retention of the information, and retrieval is the act of getting information out of storage and into conscious awareness through recall, recognition, and relearning."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,5,The idea that information is processed through three memory systems is called the Atkinson-Shiffrin (A-S) model of memory.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,6,"First, environmental stimuli enter our sensory memory for a period of less than a second to a few seconds."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,7,Those stimuli that we notice and pay attention to then move into short-term memory (also called working memory).
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,8,"According to the A-S model, if we rehearse this information, then it moves into long-term memory for permanent storage."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,9,Other models like that of Baddeley and Hitch suggest there is more of a feedback loop between short-term memory and long-term memory.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,10,Long-term memory has a practically limitless storage capacity and is divided into implicit and explicit memory.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,11,"Finally, retrieval is the act of getting memories out of storage and back into conscious awareness."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,12,"This is done through recall, recognition, and relearning."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,13,"8.2     Parts of the Brain Involved with Memory   Beginning with Karl Lashley, researchers and psychologists have been searching for the engram, which is the physical trace of memory."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,14,"Lashley did not find the engram, but he did suggest that memories are distributed throughout the entire brain rather than stored in one specific area."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,15,"Now we know that three brain areas do play significant roles in the processing and storage of different types of memories: cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,16,"The cerebellum's job is to process procedural memories; the hippocampus is where new memories are encoded; the amygdala helps determine what memories to store, and it plays a part in determining where the memories are stored based on whether we have a strong or weak emotional response to the event."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,17,"Strong emotional experiences can trigger the release of neurotransmitters, as well as hormones, which strengthen memory, so that memory for an emotional event is usually stronger than memory for a non-emotional event."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,18,This is shown by what is known as the flashbulb memory phenomenon: our ability to remember significant life events.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,19,"However, our memory for life events (autobiographical memory) is not always accurate."

939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,21,"Our memory is flexible and prone to many errors, which is why eyewitness testimony has been found to be largely unreliable."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,22,There are several reasons why forgetting occurs.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,23,"In cases of brain trauma or disease, forgetting may be due to amnesia."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,24,Another reason we forget is due to encoding failure.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,25,We can't remember something if we never stored it in our memory in the first place.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,26,Schacter presents seven memory errors that also contribute to forgetting.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,27,"Sometimes, information is actually stored in our memory, but we cannot access it due to interference."
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,28,Proactive interference happens when old information hinders the recall of newly learned information.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,29,Retroactive interference happens when information learned more recently hinders the recall of older information.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,30,8.4     Ways to Enhance Memory   There are many ways to combat the inevitable failures of our memory system.
939e334d-f570-5fbc-808e-93d15f212114@12.2,8,7,Summary,31,"Some common strategies that can be used in everyday situations include mnemonic devices, rehearsal, self-referencing, and adequate sleep."

fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,2,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Define and distinguish between the three domains of development: physical, cognitive and psychosocial   Discuss the normative approach to development   Understand the three major issues in development: continuity and discontinuity, one common course of development or many unique courses of development, and nature versus nurture         My heart leaps up when I behold    A rainbow in the sky:    So was it when my life began;    So is it now I am a man;    So be it when I shall grow old,    Or let me die!"

fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,4,"Wordsworth, 1802)      In this poem, William Wordsworth writes, ""the child is father of the man."""
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,5,"What does this seemingly incongruous statement mean, and what does it have to do with lifespan development?"
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,6,Wordsworth might be suggesting that the person he is as an adult depends largely on the experiences he had in childhood.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,7,Consider the following questions: To what extent is the adult you are today influenced by the child you once were?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,8,To what extent is a child fundamentally different from the adult he grows up to be?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,9,"These are the types of questions developmental psychologists try to answer, by studying how humans change and grow from conception through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and death."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,10,"They view development as a lifelong process that can be studied scientifically across three developmental domains—physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,11,"Physical development  involves growth and changes in the body and brain, the senses, motor skills, and health and wellness."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,12,"Cognitive development  involves learning, attention, memory, language, thinking, reasoning, and creativity."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,13,"Psychosocial development  involves emotions, personality, and social relationships."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,14,We refer to these domains throughout the chapter.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,15,Connect the Concepts     Research Methods in Developmental Psychology   You've learned about a variety of research methods used by psychologists.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,16,Developmental psychologists use many of these approaches in order to better understand how individuals change mentally and physically over time.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,17,"These methods include naturalistic observations, case studies, surveys, and experiments, among others."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,18,Naturalistic observations involve observing behavior in its natural context.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,19,"A developmental psychologist might observe how children behave on a playground, at a daycare center, or in the child's own home."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,20,"While this research approach provides a glimpse into how children behave in their natural settings, researchers have very little control over the types and/or frequencies of displayed behavior."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,21,"In a case study, developmental psychologists collect a great deal of information from one individual in order to better understand physical and psychological changes over the lifespan."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,22,"This particular approach is an excellent way to better understand individuals, who are exceptional in some way, but it is especially prone to researcher bias in interpretation, and it is difficult to generalize conclusions to the larger population."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,23,"In one classic example of this research method being applied to a study of lifespan development Sigmund Freud analyzed the development of a child known as ""Little Hans"" (Freud, 1909/1949)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,24,"Freud's findings helped inform his theories of psychosexual development in children, which you will learn about later in this chapter."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,25,"Little Genie, the subject of a case study discussed in the chapter on thinking and intelligence, provides another example of how psychologists examine developmental milestones through detailed research on a single individual."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,26,"In Genie's case, her neglectful and abusive upbringing led to her being unable to speak until, at age 13, she was removed from that harmful environment."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,27,"As she learned to use language, psychologists were able to compare how her language acquisition abilities differed when occurring in her late-stage development compared to the typical acquisition of those skills during the ages of infancy through early childhood (Fromkin, Krashen, Curtiss, Rigler, &amp; Rigler, 1974; Curtiss, 1981)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,28,"The survey method asks individuals to self-report important information about their thoughts, experiences, and beliefs."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,29,"This particular method can provide large amounts of information in relatively short amounts of time; however, validity of data collected in this way relies on honest self-reporting, and the data is relatively shallow when compared to the depth of information collected in a case study."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,30,An example of comprehensive survey was the research done by Ruth W. Howard.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,31,"In 1947, she obtained her doctorate by surveying 229 sets of triplets, the most comprehensive research of triplets completed at the time."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,32,"This pioneering woman was also the first African-American woman to earn a PhD in psychology (American Psychological Association, 2019)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,33,Experiments involve significant control over extraneous variables and manipulation of the independent variable.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,34,"As such, experimental research allows developmental psychologists to make causal statements about certain variables that are important for the developmental process."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,35,"Because experimental research must occur in a controlled environment, researchers must be cautious about whether behaviors observed in the laboratory translate to an individual's natural environment."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,36,"Later in this chapter, you will learn about several experiments in which toddlers and young children observe scenes or actions so that researchers can determine at what age specific cognitive abilities develop."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,37,"For example, children may observe a quantity of liquid poured from a short, fat glass into a tall, skinny glass."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,38,"As the experimenters question the children about what occurred, the subjects' answers help psychologists understand at what age a child begins to comprehend that the volume of liquid remained the same although the shapes of the containers differs."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,39,"Across these three domains—physical, cognitive, and psychosocial—the  normative approach  to development is also discussed."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,40,"This approach asks, ""What is normal development?"""
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,41,"In the early decades of the 20th century, normative psychologists studied large numbers of children at various ages to determine norms (i.e., average ages) of when most children reach specific developmental milestones in each of the three domains (Gesell, 1933, 1939, 1940; Gesell &amp; Ilg, 1946; Hall, 1904)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,42,"Although children develop at slightly different rates, we can use these age-related averages as general guidelines to compare children with same-age peers to determine the approximate ages they should reach specific normative events called  developmental milestones  (e.g., crawling, walking, writing, dressing, naming colors, speaking in sentences, and starting puberty)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,43,"Not all normative events are universal, meaning they are not experienced by all individuals across all cultures."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,44,"Biological milestones, such as puberty, tend to be universal, but social milestones, such as the age when children begin formal schooling, are not necessarily universal; instead, they affect most individuals in a particular  culture  (Gesell &amp; Ilg, 1946)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,45,"For example, in developed countries children begin school around 5 or 6 years old, but in developing countries, like Nigeria, children often enter school at an advanced age, if at all (Huebler, 2005; United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2013)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,46,"To better understand the normative approach, imagine two new mothers, Louisa and Kimberly, who are close friends and have children around the same age."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,47,"Louisa's daughter is 14 months old, and Kimberly's son is 12 months old."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,48,"According to the normative approach, the average age a child starts to walk is 12 months."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,49,"However, at 14 months Louisa's daughter still isn't walking."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,50,She tells Kimberly she is worried that something might be wrong with her baby.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,51,Kimberly is surprised because her son started walking when he was only 10 months old.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,52,Should Louisa be worried?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,53,Should she be concerned if her daughter is not walking by 15 months or 18 months?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,54,Link to Learning      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes the developmental milestones for children from 2 months through 5 years old.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,55,"After reviewing the information, take this  quiz  to see how well you recall what you've learned."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,56,"If you are a parent with concerns about your child's development, contact your pediatrician."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,57,Issues in Developmental Psychology   There are many different theoretical approaches regarding human development.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,58,"As we evaluate them in this chapter, recall that developmental psychology focuses on how people change, and keep in mind that all the approaches that we present in this chapter address questions of change: Is the change smooth or uneven (continuous versus discontinuous)?"
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,59,"Is this pattern of change the same for everyone, or are there many different patterns of change (one course of development versus many courses)?"

fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,61,Is Development Continuous or Discontinuous?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,62,"Continuous development  views development as a cumulative process, gradually improving on existing skills ( Figure 9.2 )."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,63,"With this type of development, there is gradual change."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,64,"Consider, for example, a child's physical growth: adding inches to her height year by year."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,65,"In contrast, theorists who view development as  discontinuous  believe that development takes place in unique stages: It occurs at specific times or ages."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,66,"With this type of development, the change is more sudden, such as an infant's ability to conceive object permanence."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,67,"Figure   9.2        The concept of continuous development can be visualized as a smooth slope of progression, whereas discontinuous development sees growth in more discrete stages."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,68,Is There One Course of Development or Many?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,69,"Is development essentially the same, or universal, for all children (i.e., there is one course of development) or does development follow a different course for each child, depending on the child's specific genetics and environment (i.e., there are many courses of development)?"
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,70,Do people across the world share more similarities or more differences in their development?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,71,How much do culture and genetics influence a child's behavior?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,72,Stage theories hold that the sequence of development is universal.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,73,"For example, in cross-cultural studies of language development, children from around the world reach language milestones in a similar sequence (Gleitman &amp; Newport, 1995)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,74,Infants in all cultures coo before they babble.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,75,They begin babbling at about the same age and utter their first word around 12 months old.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,76,Yet we live in diverse contexts that have a unique effect on each of us.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,77,"For example, researchers once believed that motor development follows one course for all children regardless of culture."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,78,"However, child care practices vary by culture, and different practices have been found to accelerate or inhibit achievement of developmental milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking (Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, &amp; Bornstein, 2010)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,79,"For instance, let's look at the Aché society in Paraguay."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,80,They spend a significant amount of time foraging in forests.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,81,"While foraging, Aché mothers carry their young children, rarely putting them down in order to protect them from getting hurt in the forest."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,82,"Consequently, their children walk much later: They walk around 23–25 months old, in comparison to infants in Western cultures who begin to walk around 12 months old."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,83,"However, as Aché children become older, they are allowed more freedom to move about, and by about age 9, their motor skills surpass those of U.S. children of the same age: Aché children are able to climb trees up to 25 feet tall and use machetes to chop their way through the forest (Kaplan &amp; Dove, 1987)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,84,"As you can see, our development is influenced by multiple contexts, so the timing of basic motor functions may vary across cultures."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,85,"However, the functions themselves are present in all societies ( Figure 9.3 )."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,86,Figure   9.3        All children across the world love to play.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,87,"Whether in (a) Florida or (b) South Africa, children enjoy exploring sand, sunshine, and the sea."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,88,How Do Nature and Nurture Influence Development?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,89,"Are we who we are because of  nature  (biology and genetics), or are we who we are because of  nurture  (our environment and culture)?"
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,90,This longstanding question is known in psychology as the nature versus nurture debate.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,91,"It seeks to understand how our personalities and traits are the product of our genetic makeup and biological factors, and how they are shaped by our environment, including our parents, peers, and culture."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,92,"For instance, why do biological children sometimes act like their parents—is it because of genetics or because of early childhood environment and what the child has learned from the parents?"
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,93,What about children who are adopted—are they more like their biological families or more like their adoptive families?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,94,And how can siblings from the same family be so different?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,95,"We are all born with specific genetic traits inherited from our parents, such as eye color, height, and certain personality traits."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,96,"Beyond our basic genotype, however, there is a deep interaction between our genes and our environment: Our unique experiences in our environment influence whether and how particular traits are expressed, and at the same time, our genes influence how we interact with our environment (Diamond, 2009; Lobo, 2008)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,97,"This chapter will show that there is a reciprocal interaction between nature and nurture as they both shape who we become, but the debate continues as to the relative contributions of each."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,98,Dig Deeper     The Achievement Gap: How Does Socioeconomic Status Affect Development?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,99,"The achievement gap refers to the persistent difference in grades, test scores, and graduation rates that exist among students of different ethnicities, races, and—in certain subjects—sexes (Winerman, 2011)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,100,Research suggests that these achievement gaps are strongly influenced by differences in socioeconomic factors that exist among the families of these children.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,101,"While the researchers acknowledge that programs aimed at reducing such socioeconomic discrepancies would likely aid in equalizing the aptitude and performance of children from different backgrounds, they recognize that such large-scale interventions would be difficult to achieve."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,102,"Therefore, it is recommended that programs aimed at fostering aptitude and achievement among disadvantaged children may be the best option for dealing with issues related to academic achievement gaps (Duncan &amp; Magnuson, 2005)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,103,"Low-income children perform significantly more poorly than their middle- and high-income peers on a number of educational variables: They have significantly lower standardized test scores, graduation rates, and college entrance rates, and they have much higher school dropout rates."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,104,"There have been attempts to correct the achievement gap through state and federal legislation, but what if the problems start before the children even enter school?"
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,105,Psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley (2006) spent their careers looking at early language ability and progression of children in various income levels.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,106,"In one longitudinal study, they found that although all the parents in the study engaged and interacted with their children, middle- and high-income parents interacted with their children differently than low-income parents."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,107,"After analyzing 1,300 hours of parent-child interactions, the researchers found that middle- and high-income parents talk to their children significantly more, starting when the children are infants."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,108,"By 3 years old, high-income children knew almost double the number of words known by their low-income counterparts, and they had heard an estimated total of 30 million more words than the low-income counterparts (Hart &amp; Risley, 2003)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,109,And the gaps only become more pronounced.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,110,"Before entering kindergarten, high-income children score 60% higher on achievement tests than their low-income peers (Lee &amp; Burkam, 2002)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,111,There are solutions to this problem.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,112,"At the University of Chicago, experts are working with low-income families, visiting them at their homes, and encouraging them to speak more to their children on a daily and hourly basis."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,113,Other experts are designing preschools in which students from diverse economic backgrounds are placed in the same classroom.
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,114,"In this research, low-income children made significant gains in their language development, likely as a result of attending the specialized preschool (Schechter &amp; Byeb, 2007)."
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,115,What other methods or interventions could be used to decrease the achievement gap?
fb83c68a-2bc6-4a0a-ba0f-b79ceb75594b@12,9,2,,116,What types of activities could be implemented to help the children of your community or a neighboring community?
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,1,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Discuss Freud's theory of psychosexual development   Describe the major tasks of child and adult psychosocial development according to Erikson   Discuss Piaget's view of cognitive development and apply the stages to understanding childhood cognition   Describe Kohlberg's theory of moral development       There are many theories regarding how babies and children grow and develop into happy, healthy adults."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,2,We explore several of these theories in this section.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,3,Psychosexual Theory of Development   Sigmund  Freud  (1856–1939) believed that personality develops during early childhood.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,4,"For Freud, childhood experiences shape our personalities and behavior as adults."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,5,"Freud viewed development as discontinuous; he believed that each of us must pass through a series of stages during childhood, and that if we lack proper nurturance and parenting during a stage, we may become stuck, or fixated, in that stage."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,6,Freud's stages are called the stages of  psychosexual development .
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,7,"According to Freud, children's pleasure-seeking urges are focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone, at each of the five stages of development: oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,8,"While most of Freud's ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,9,"Psychologists today dispute Freud's psychosexual stages as a legitimate explanation for how one's personality develops, but what we can take away from Freud's theory is that personality is shaped, in some part, by experiences we have in childhood."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,10,These stages are discussed in detail in the chapter on personality.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,11,"Psychosocial Theory of Development   Erik  Erikson  (1902–1994) ( Figure 9.4 ), another stage theorist, took Freud's theory and modified it as psychosocial theory."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,12,Erikson's  psychosocial development  theory emphasizes the social nature of our development rather than its sexual nature.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,13,"While Freud believed that personality is shaped only in childhood, Erikson proposed that personality development takes place all through the lifespan."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,14,"Erikson suggested that how we interact with others is what affects our sense of self, or what he called the ego identity."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,15,Figure   9.4        Erik Erikson proposed the psychosocial theory of development.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,16,"In each stage of Erikson's theory, there is a psychosocial task that we must master in order to feel a sense of competence."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,17,Erikson proposed that we are motivated by a need to achieve competence in certain areas of our lives.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,18,"According to psychosocial theory, we experience eight stages of development over our lifespan, from infancy through late adulthood."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,19,"At each stage there is a conflict, or task, that we need to resolve."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,20,Successful completion of each developmental task results in a sense of competence and a healthy personality.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,21,Failure to master these tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,22,"According to Erikson (1963), trust is the basis of our development during infancy (birth to 12 months)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,23,"Therefore, the primary task of this stage is trust versus mistrust."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,24,"Infants are dependent upon their caregivers, so caregivers who are responsive and sensitive to their infant's needs help their baby to develop a sense of trust; their baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,25,"Unresponsive caregivers who do not meet their baby's needs can engender feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the world as unpredictable."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,26,"As toddlers (ages 1–3 years) begin to explore their world, they learn that they can control their actions and act on the environment to get results."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,27,"They begin to show clear preferences for certain elements of the environment, such as food, toys, and clothing."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,28,"A toddler's main task is to resolve the issue of autonomy versus shame and doubt, by working to establish independence."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,29,"This is the ""me do it"" stage."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,30,"For example, we might observe a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-year-old child who wants to choose her clothes and dress herself."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,31,"Although her outfits might not be appropriate for the situation, her input in such basic decisions has an effect on her sense of independence."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,32,"If denied the opportunity to act on her environment, she may begin to doubt her abilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,33,"Once children reach the preschool stage (ages 3–6 years), they are capable of initiating activities and asserting control over their world through social interactions and play."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,34,"According to Erikson, preschool children must resolve the task of initiative versus guilt."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,35,"By learning to plan and achieve goals while interacting with others, preschool children can master this task."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,36,Those who do will develop self-confidence and feel a sense of purpose.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,37,Those who are unsuccessful at this stage—with their initiative misfiring or stifled—may develop feelings of guilt.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,38,How might over-controlling parents stifle a child's initiative?
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,39,"During the elementary school stage (ages 6–12), children face the task of industry versus inferiority."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,40,Children begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,41,"They either develop a sense of pride and accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and inadequate when they don't measure up."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,42,What are some things parents and teachers can do to help children develop a sense of competence and a belief in themselves and their abilities?
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,43,"In adolescence (ages 12–18), children face the task of identity versus role confusion."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,44,"According to Erikson, an adolescent's main task is developing a sense of self."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,45,"Adolescents struggle with questions such as ""Who am I?"""
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,46,"and ""What do I want to do with my life?"""
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,47,"Along the way, most adolescents try on many different selves to see which ones fit."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,48,Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a strong sense of identity and are able to remain true to their beliefs and values in the face of problems and other people's perspectives.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,49,"What happens to apathetic adolescents, who do not make a conscious search for identity, or those who are pressured to conform to their parents' ideas for the future?"
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,50,These teens will have a weak sense of self and experience role confusion.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,51,They are unsure of their identity and confused about the future.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,52,"People in early adulthood (i.e., 20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy versus isolation."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,53,"After we have developed a sense of self in adolescence, we are ready to share our life with others."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,54,Erikson said that we must have a strong sense of self before developing intimate relationships with others.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,55,Adults who do not develop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and emotional isolation.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,56,"When people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the mid-60s."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,57,The social task of middle adulthood is generativity versus stagnation.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,58,"Generativity involves finding your life's work and contributing to the development of others, through activities such as volunteering, mentoring, and raising children."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,59,"Those who do not master this task may experience stagnation, having little connection with others and little interest in productivity and self-improvement."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,60,"From the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in the period of development known as late adulthood."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,61,Erikson's task at this stage is called integrity versus despair.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,62,He said that people in late adulthood reflect on their lives and feel either a sense of satisfaction or a sense of failure.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,63,"People who feel proud of their accomplishments feel a sense of integrity, and they can look back on their lives with few regrets."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,64,"However, people who are not successful at this stage may feel as if their life has been wasted."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,65,"They focus on what ""would have,"" ""should have,"" and ""could have"" been."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,69,"Instead of approaching development from a psychoanalytical or psychosocial perspective, Piaget focused on children's cognitive growth."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,70,He believed that thinking is a central aspect of development and that children are naturally inquisitive.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,71,"However, he said that children do not think and reason like adults (Piaget, 1930, 1932)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,72,"His theory of cognitive development holds that our cognitive abilities develop through specific stages, which exemplifies the discontinuity approach to development."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,75,Piaget said that children develop schemata to help them understand the world.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,76,Schemata  are concepts (mental models) that are used to help us categorize and interpret information.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,77,"By the time children have reached adulthood, they have created schemata for almost everything."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,78,"When children learn new information, they adjust their schemata through two processes: assimilation and accommodation."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,79,"First, they assimilate new information or experiences in terms of their current schemata:  assimilation  is when they take in information that is comparable to what they already know."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,80,Accommodation  describes when they change their schemata based on new information.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,81,This process continues as children interact with their environment.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,82,"For example, 2-year-old Blake learned the schema for dogs because his family has a Labrador retriever."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,83,"When Blake sees other dogs in his picture books, he says, ""Look mommy, dog!"""
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,84,"Thus, he has assimilated them into his schema for dogs."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,85,"One day, Blake sees a sheep for the first time and says, ""Look mommy, dog!"""
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,86,"Having a basic schema that a dog is an animal with four legs and fur, Blake thinks all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,87,"When Blake's mom tells him that the animal he sees is a sheep, not a dog, Blake must accommodate his schema for dogs to include more information based on his new experiences."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,88,"Blake's schema for dog was too broad, since not all furry, four-legged creatures are dogs."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,89,He now modifies his schema for dogs and forms a new one for sheep.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,90,"Like Freud and Erikson, Piaget thought development unfolds in a series of stages approximately associated with age ranges."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,91,"He proposed a theory of cognitive development that unfolds in four stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational ( Table 9.2 )."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,94,"Young children put objects in their mouths to see if the items are edible, and once they can grasp objects, they may shake or bang them to see if they make sounds."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,95,"Between 5 and 8 months old, the child develops  object permanence , which is the understanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists (Bogartz, Shinskey, &amp; Schilling, 2000)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,96,"According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,97,Piaget studied infants' reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a blanket.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,98,"Infants who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy, indicating that they knew it still existed, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence would appear confused."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,100,"In Piaget's view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to exhibit stranger anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,101,"Babies may demonstrate this by crying and turning away from a stranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their arms toward familiar faces such as parents."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,102,"Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore, she can't predict what her experience with that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,103,"Piaget's second stage is the  preoperational stage , which is from approximately 2 to 7 years old."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,104,"In this stage, children can use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is why children in this stage engage in pretend play."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,105,"A child's arms might become airplane wings as he zooms around the room, or a child with a stick might become a brave knight with a sword."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,106,"Children also begin to use language in the preoperational stage, but they cannot understand adult logic or mentally manipulate information (the term  operational  refers to logical manipulation of information, so children at this stage are considered to be  pre -operational)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,107,"Children's logic is based on their own personal knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional knowledge."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,110,"Children in this stage cannot perform mental operations because they have not developed an understanding of  conservation , which is the idea that even if you change the appearance of something, it is still equal in size as long as nothing has been removed or added."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,118,Link to Learning      Piaget developed the Three-Mountain Task to determine the level of egocentrism displayed by children.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,119,"Children view a 3-dimensional mountain scene from one viewpoint, and are asked what another person at a different viewpoint would see in the same scene."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,121,"Piaget's third stage is the  concrete operational stage , which occurs from about 7 to 11 years old."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,122,"In this stage, children can think logically about real (concrete) events; they have a firm grasp on the use of numbers and start to employ memory strategies."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,123,"They can perform mathematical operations and understand transformations, such as addition is the opposite of subtraction, and multiplication is the opposite of division."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,124,"In this stage, children also master the concept of conservation: Even if something changes shape, its mass, volume, and number stay the same."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,125,"For example, if you pour water from a tall, thin glass to a short, fat glass, you still have the same amount of water."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,128,"Children in the concrete operational stage also understand the principle of  reversibility , which means that objects can be changed and then returned back to their original form or condition."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,129,"Take, for example, water that you poured into the short, fat glass: You can pour water from the fat glass back to the thin glass and still have the same amount (minus a couple of drops)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,130,"The fourth, and last, stage in Piaget's theory is the  formal operational stage , which is from about age 11 to adulthood."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,131,"Whereas children in the concrete operational stage are able to think logically only about concrete events, children in the formal operational stage can also deal with abstract ideas and hypothetical situations."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,132,"Children in this stage can use abstract thinking to problem solve, look at alternative solutions, and test these solutions."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,135,"Beyond Formal Operational Thought   As with other major contributors of theories of development, several of Piaget's ideas have come under criticism based on the results of further research."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,136,"For example, several contemporary studies support a model of development that is more continuous than Piaget's discrete stages (Courage &amp; Howe, 2002; Siegler, 2005, 2006)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,137,"Many others suggest that children reach cognitive milestones earlier than Piaget describes (Baillargeon, 2004; de Hevia &amp; Spelke, 2010)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,138,"According to Piaget, the highest level of cognitive development is formal operational thought, which develops between 11 and 20 years old."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,139,"However, many developmental psychologists disagree with Piaget, suggesting a fifth stage of cognitive development, known as the postformal stage (Basseches, 1984; Commons &amp; Bresette, 2006; Sinnott, 1998)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,140,"In postformal thinking, decisions are made based on situations and circumstances, and logic is integrated with emotion as adults develop principles that depend on contexts."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,141,One way that we can see the difference between an adult in postformal thought and an adolescent in formal operations is in terms of how they handle emotionally charged issues.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,142,"It seems that once we reach adulthood our problem solving abilities change: As we attempt to solve problems, we tend to think more deeply about many areas of our lives, such as relationships, work, and politics (Labouvie-Vief &amp; Diehl, 1999)."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,143,"Because of this, postformal thinkers are able to draw on past experiences to help them solve new problems."

11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,145,What does this mean?
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,146,"Adults can recognize, for example, that what seems to be an ideal solution to a problem at work involving a disagreement with a colleague may not be the best solution to a disagreement with a significant other."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,147,Theory of Moral Development    A major task beginning in childhood and continuing into adolescence is discerning right from wrong.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,148,Psychologist Lawrence  Kohlberg  (1927–1987) extended upon the foundation that Piaget built regarding cognitive development.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,149,"Kohlberg believed that moral development, like cognitive development, follows a series of stages."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,150,"To develop this theory, Kohlberg posed moral dilemmas to people of all ages, and then he analyzed their answers to find evidence of their particular stage of moral development."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,151,"Before reading about the stages, take a minute to consider how you would answer one of Kohlberg's best-known moral dilemmas, commonly known as the Heinz dilemma:     In Europe, a woman was near death from a special kind of cancer."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,152,There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,153,It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,154,"The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to make."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,155,"He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,156,"The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000, which is half of what it cost."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,157,He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,158,"But the druggist said: ""No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it."""
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,159,So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's store to steal the drug for his wife.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,160,Should the husband have done that?
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,161,"Kohlberg, 1969, p. 379)     How would you answer this dilemma?"
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,162,"Kohlberg was not interested in whether you answer yes or no to the dilemma: Instead, he was interested in the reasoning behind your answer."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,163,"After presenting people with this and various other moral dilemmas, Kohlberg reviewed people's responses and placed them in different  stages of moral reasoning  ( Figure 9.6 )."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,164,"According to Kohlberg, an individual progresses from the capacity for pre-conventional morality (before age 9) to the capacity for conventional morality (early adolescence), and toward attaining post-conventional morality (once formal operational thought is attained), which only a few fully achieve."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,165,Kohlberg placed in the highest stage responses that reflected the reasoning that Heinz should steal the drug because his wife's life is more important than the pharmacist making money.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,166,The value of a human life overrides the pharmacist's greed.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,167,"Figure   9.6        Kohlberg identified three levels of moral reasoning: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional: Each level is associated with increasingly complex stages of moral development."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,168,"It is important to realize that even those people who have the most sophisticated, post-conventional reasons for some choices may make other choices for the simplest of pre-conventional reasons."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,169,Many psychologists agree with Kohlberg's theory of moral development but point out that moral reasoning is very different from moral behavior.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,170,Sometimes what we say we would do in a situation is not what we actually do in that situation.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,171,"In other words, we might ""talk the talk,"" but not ""walk the walk."""
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,172,How does this theory apply to males and females?
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,173,Kohlberg (1969) felt that more males than females move past stage four in their moral development.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,174,He went on to note that women seem to be deficient in their moral reasoning abilities.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,175,"These ideas were not well received by Carol Gilligan, a research assistant of Kohlberg, who consequently developed her own ideas of moral development."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,176,"In her groundbreaking book,  In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development , Gilligan (1982) criticized her former mentor's theory because it was based only on upper class White men and boys."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,177,She argued that women are not deficient in their moral reasoning—she proposed that males and females reason differently.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,178,Girls and women focus more on staying connected and the importance of interpersonal relationships.
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,179,"Therefore, in the Heinz dilemma, many girls and women respond that Heinz should not steal the medicine."
11da1ddc-f426-422d-8ce2-19501ca6ebb5@12,9,3,Lifespan Theories,180,"Their reasoning is that if he steals the medicine, is arrested, and is put in jail, then he and his wife will be separated, and she could die while he is still in prison."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,11,Conception  occurs when sperm fertilizes an egg and forms a zygote ( Figure 9.7 ).
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,12,A  zygote  begins as a one-cell structure that is created when a sperm and egg merge.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,13,The genetic makeup and sex of the baby are set at this point.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,14,"During the first week after conception, the zygote divides and multiplies, going from a one-cell structure to two cells, then four cells, then eight cells, and so on."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,15,This process of cell division is called  mitosis .
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,16,"Mitosis is a fragile process, and fewer than one-half of all zygotes survive beyond the first two weeks (Hall, 2004)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,17,"After 5 days of mitosis there are 100 cells, and after 9 months there are billions of cells."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,18,"As the cells divide, they become more specialized, forming different organs and body parts."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,19,"In the germinal stage, the mass of cells has yet to attach itself to the lining of the mother's uterus."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,24,"Now blood vessels grow, forming the placenta."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,25,The  placenta  is a structure connected to the uterus that provides nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing embryo via the umbilical cord.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,26,"Basic structures of the embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head, chest, and abdomen."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,29,"Fetal Stage (Weeks 9–40)   When the organism is about nine weeks old, the embryo is called a fetus."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,30,"At this stage, the fetus is about the size of a kidney bean and begins to take on the recognizable form of a human being as the ""tail"" begins to disappear."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,31,"From 9–12 weeks, the sex organs begin to differentiate."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,35,"Hearing has developed, so the fetus can respond to sounds."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,36,"The internal organs, such as the lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, have formed enough that a fetus born prematurely at this point has a chance to survive outside of the mother's womb."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,37,"Throughout the fetal stage the brain continues to grow and develop, nearly doubling in size from weeks 16 to 28."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,38,"Around 36 weeks, the fetus is almost ready for birth."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,39,"It weighs about 6 pounds and is about 18.5 inches long, and by week 37 all of the fetus's organ systems are developed enough that it could survive outside the mother's uterus without many of the risks associated with premature birth."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,40,The fetus continues to gain weight and grow in length until approximately 40 weeks.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,41,"By then, the fetus has very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,42,The progression through the stages is shown in  Figure 9.8 .

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,96,"Although small, a newborn is not completely helpless because his reflexes and sensory capacities help him interact with the environment from the moment of birth."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,97,All healthy babies are born with  newborn reflexes : inborn automatic responses to particular forms of stimulation.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,98,Reflexes help the newborn survive until it is capable of more complex behaviors—these reflexes are crucial to survival.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,99,They are present in babies whose brains are developing normally and usually disappear around 4–5 months old.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,100,Let's take a look at some of these newborn reflexes.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,101,"The rooting reflex is the newborn's response to anything that touches her cheek: When you stroke a baby's cheek, she naturally turns her head in that direction and begins to suck."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,102,"The sucking reflex is the automatic, unlearned, sucking motions that infants do with their mouths."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,103,Several other interesting newborn reflexes can be observed.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,104,"For instance, if you put your finger into a newborn's hand, you will witness the grasping reflex, in which a baby automatically grasps anything that touches his palms."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,105,The Moro reflex is the newborn's response when she feels like she is falling.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,106,"The baby spreads her arms, pulls them back in, and then (usually) cries."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,107,How do you think these reflexes promote survival in the first months of life?

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,110,"Newborn infants' sensory abilities are significant, but their senses are not yet fully developed."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,111,Many of a newborn's innate preferences facilitate interaction with caregivers and other humans.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,112,"Although vision is their least developed sense, newborns already show a preference for faces."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,113,"Babies who are just a few days old also prefer human voices, they will listen to voices longer than sounds that do not involve speech (Vouloumanos &amp; Werker, 2004), and they seem to prefer their mother's voice over a stranger's voice (Mills &amp; Melhuish, 1974)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,114,"In an interesting experiment, 3-week-old babies were given pacifiers that played a recording of the infant's mother's voice and of a stranger's voice."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,115,"When the infants heard their mother's voice, they sucked more strongly at the pacifier (Mills &amp; Melhuish, 1974)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,116,Newborns also have a strong sense of smell.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,117,"For instance, newborn babies can distinguish the smell of their own mother from that of others."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,118,"In a study by MacFarlane (1978), 1-week-old babies who were being breastfed were placed between two gauze pads."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,119,"One gauze pad was from the bra of a nursing mother who was a stranger, and the other gauze pad was from the bra of the infant's own mother."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,120,More than two-thirds of the week-old babies turned toward the gauze pad with their mother's scent.

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,127,Growth slows between 4 and 6 years old: During this time children gain 5–7 pounds and grow about 2–3 inches per year.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,128,"Once girls reach 8–9 years old, their growth rate outpaces that of boys due to a pubertal growth spurt."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,129,"This growth spurt continues until around 12 years old, coinciding with the start of the menstrual cycle."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,130,"By 10 years old, the average girl weighs 88 pounds, and the average boy weighs 85 pounds."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,131,"We are born with all of the brain cells that we will ever have—about 100–200 billion neurons (nerve cells) whose function is to store and transmit information (Huttenlocher &amp; Dabholkar, 1997)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,132,"However, the nervous system continues to grow and develop."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,133,Each neural pathway forms thousands of new connections during infancy and toddlerhood.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,134,This period of rapid neural growth is called blooming.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,135,Neural pathways continue to develop through puberty.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,136,"The blooming period of neural growth is then followed by a period of pruning, where neural connections are reduced."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,137,"It is thought that pruning causes the brain to function more efficiently, allowing for mastery of more complex skills (Hutchinson, 2011)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,138,"Blooming occurs during the first few years of life, and pruning continues through childhood and into adolescence in various areas of the brain."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,139,The size of our brains increases rapidly.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,140,"For example, the brain of a 2-year-old is 55% of its adult size, and by 6 years old the brain is about 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,141,"During early childhood (ages 3–6), the frontal lobes grow rapidly."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,142,"Recalling our discussion of the 4 lobes of the brain earlier in this book, the frontal lobes are associated with planning, reasoning, memory, and impulse control."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,143,"Therefore, by the time children reach school age, they are developmentally capable of controlling their attention and behavior."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,144,"Through the elementary school years, the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes all grow in size."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,145,"The brain growth spurts experienced in childhood tend to follow Piaget's sequence of cognitive development, so that significant changes in neural functioning account for cognitive advances (Kolb &amp; Whishaw, 2009; Overman, Bachevalier, Turner, &amp; Peuster, 1992)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,146,"Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (e.g., sucking and rooting) to more advanced motor functioning."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,147,"For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to sit with assistance, and then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling and then walking."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,148,Motor skills  refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,149,"Fine motor skills  focus on the muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping a toy, writing with a pencil, and using a spoon)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,150,"Gross motor skills  focus on large muscle groups that control our arms and legs and involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,151,"As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children should achieve ( Table 9.4 )."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,152,"For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the milestone should be reached."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,153,An example of a developmental milestone is sitting.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,154,"On average, most babies sit alone at 7 months old."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,155,"Sitting involves both coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between 5 and 9 months old."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,156,"In another example, babies on average are able to hold up their head at 6 weeks old, and 90% of babies achieve this between 3 weeks and 4 months old."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,157,"If a baby is not holding up his head by 4 months old, he is showing a delay."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,158,"If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for concern, and the parent or caregiver should discuss this with the child's pediatrician."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,159,Some developmental delays can be identified and addressed through early intervention.

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,161,Piaget thought that children's ability to understand objects—such as learning that a rattle makes a noise when shaken—was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with the environment.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,162,"Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,163,"Researchers have found that even very young children understand objects and how they work long before they have experience with those objects (Baillargeon, 1987; Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, &amp; Wu, 2011)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,164,"For example, children as young as 3 months old demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did not have prior experience with them."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,165,"In one study, 3-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling down a track and behind a screen."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,167,The truck rolled past the box as would be expected.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,168,Then the box was placed on the track to block the path of the truck.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,169,"When the truck was rolled down the track this time, it continued unimpeded."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,170,The infants spent significantly more time looking at this impossible event ( Figure 9.11 ).
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,171,Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects cannot pass through each other.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,172,"Baillargeon's findings suggest that very young children have an understanding of objects and how they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to their limited experiences in the world."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,173,"Figure   9.11        In Baillargeon's study, infants observed a truck (a) roll down an unobstructed track, (b) roll down an unobstructed track with an obstruction (box) beside it, and (c) roll down and pass through what appeared to be an obstruction."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,174,"Just as there are physical milestones that we expect children to reach, there are also cognitive milestones."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,175,"It is helpful to be aware of these milestones as children gain new abilities to think, problem solve, and communicate."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,176,"For example, infants shake their head ""no"" around 6–9 months, and they respond to verbal requests to do things like ""wave bye-bye"" or ""blow a kiss"" around 9–12 months."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,177,Remember Piaget's ideas about object permanence?
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,178,We can expect children to grasp the concept that objects continue to exist even when they are not in sight by around 8 months old.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,179,"Because toddlers (i.e., 12–24 months old) have mastered object permanence, they enjoy games like hide and seek, and they realize that when someone leaves the room they will come back (Loop, 2013)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,180,Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in appropriate places when you ask them to find objects.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,181,"Preschool-age children (i.e., 3–5 years old) also make steady progress in cognitive development."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,182,"Not only can they count, name colors, and tell you their name and age, but they can also make some decisions on their own, such as choosing an outfit to wear."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,183,"Preschool-age children understand basic time concepts and sequencing (e.g., before and after), and they can predict what will happen next in a story."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,184,They also begin to enjoy the use of humor in stories.

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,203,One well-researched aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,204,"As mentioned earlier, the order in which children learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures (Hatch, 1983)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,205,You've also learned that some psychological researchers have proposed that children possess a biological predisposition for language acquisition.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,206,"Starting before birth, babies begin to develop language and communication skills."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,207,"At birth, babies apparently recognize their mother's voice and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their mothers and foreign languages, and they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible language (Blossom &amp; Morgan, 2006; Pickens, 1994; Spelke &amp; Cortelyou, 1981)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,208,"Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some evidence that gesture usage predicts subsequent language development (Iverson &amp; Goldin-Meadow, 2005)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,209,"In terms of producing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,210,"Cooing is a one-syllable combination of a consonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba)."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,223,What accounts for such dramatic language learning by children?
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,224,"Behaviorist B. F. Skinner thought that we learn language in response to reinforcement or feedback, such as through parental approval or through being understood."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,225,"For example, when a two-year-old child asks for juice, he might say, ""me juice,"" to which his mother might respond by giving him a cup of apple juice."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,226,Noam Chomsky (1957) criticized Skinner's theory and proposed that we are all born with an innate capacity to learn language.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,227,Chomsky called this mechanism a language acquisition device (LAD).
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,228,Who is correct?
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,229,Both Chomsky and Skinner are right.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,230,Remember that we are a product of both nature and nurture.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,231,"Researchers now believe that language acquisition is partially inborn and partially learned through our interactions with our linguistic environment (Gleitman &amp; Newport, 1995; Stork &amp; Widdowson, 1974)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,232,"Attachment   Psychosocial development occurs as children form relationships, interact with others, and understand and manage their feelings."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,233,"In social and emotional development, forming healthy attachments is very important and is the major social milestone of infancy."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,234,Attachment  is a long-standing connection or bond with others.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,235,Developmental psychologists are interested in how infants reach this milestone.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,236,They ask such questions as: How do parent and infant attachment bonds form?
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,237,How does neglect affect these bonds?
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,238,What accounts for children's attachment differences?
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,239,"Researchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies designed to answer these questions."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,240,"In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of experiments on monkeys."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,241,He separated newborn monkeys from their mothers.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,242,Each monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,243,"One surrogate monkey was made out of wire mesh, and she could dispense milk."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,244,The other monkey was softer and made from cloth: This monkey did not dispense milk.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,245,"Research shows that the monkeys preferred the soft, cuddly cloth monkey, even though she did not provide any nourishment."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,246,The baby monkeys spent their time clinging to the cloth monkey and only went to the wire monkey when they needed to be fed.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,247,"Prior to this study, the medical and scientific communities generally thought that babies become attached to the people who provide their nourishment."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,248,"However, Harlow (1958) concluded that there was more to the mother-child bond than nourishment."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,249,"Feelings of comfort and security are the critical components to maternal-infant bonding, which leads to healthy psychosocial development."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,252,"Building on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the concept of attachment theory."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,253,"He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that an infant forms with the mother (Bowlby, 1969)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,254,An infant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and emotional development.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,255,"In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful and continues throughout life."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,256,He used the concept of secure base to define a healthy attachment between parent and child (1988).
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,257,A  secure base  is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety as he explores his surroundings.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,258,"Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment: The caregiver must be responsive to the child's physical, social, and emotional needs; and the caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions (Bowlby, 1969) ( Figure 9.13 )."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,260,research showed otherwise.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,261,"Ainsworth wanted to know if children differ in the ways they bond, and if so, why."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,262,"To find the answers, she used the Strange Situation procedure to study attachment between mothers and their infants (1970)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,263,"In the Strange Situation, the mother (or primary caregiver) and the infant (age 12-18 months) are placed in a room together."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,264,"There are toys in the room, and the caregiver and child spend some time alone in the room."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,265,"After the child has had time to explore her surroundings, a stranger enters the room."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,266,The mother then leaves her baby with the stranger.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,267,"After a few minutes, she returns to comfort her child."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,268,"Based on how the infants/toddlers responded to the separation and reunion, Ainsworth identified three types of parent-child attachments: secure, avoidant, and resistant (Ainsworth &amp; Bell, 1970)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,269,"A fourth style, known as disorganized attachment, was later described (Main &amp; Solomon, 1990)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,270,The most common type of attachment—also considered the healthiest—is called  secure attachment  ( Figure 9.14 ).

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,272,The attachment figure is used as a secure base to explore the environment and is sought out in times of stress.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,273,"Securely attached children were distressed when their caregivers left the room in the Strange Situation experiment, but when their caregivers returned, the securely attached children were happy to see them."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,274,Securely attached children have caregivers who are sensitive and responsive to their needs.

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,279,"Ainsworth theorized that these children were most likely to have a caregiver who was insensitive and inattentive to their needs (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978)."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,280,"In cases of  resistant attachment , children tend to show clingy behavior, but then they reject the attachment figure's attempts to interact with them (Ainsworth &amp; Bell, 1970)."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,284,Resistant attachment is the result of the caregivers' inconsistent level of response to their child.
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,285,"Finally, children with  disorganized attachment  behaved oddly in the Strange Situation."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,325,"Baumrind developed and refined a theory describing four parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and uninvolved."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,326,"With the  authoritative style , the parent gives reasonable demands and consistent limits, expresses warmth and affection, and listens to the child's point of view."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,331,"However, effective parenting styles vary as a function of culture and, as Small (1999) points out, the authoritative style is not necessarily preferred or appropriate in all cultures."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,332,"In  authoritarian style , the parent places high value on conformity and obedience."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,334,"In contrast to the authoritative style, authoritarian parents probably would not relax bedtime rules during a vacation because they consider the rules to be set, and they expect obedience."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,335,"This style can create anxious, withdrawn, and unhappy kids."
6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,336,"However, it is important to point out that authoritarian parenting is as beneficial as the authoritative style in some ethnic groups (Russell, Crockett, &amp; Chao, 2010)."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,341,"In terms of our example of vacation bedtimes, permissive parents might not have bedtime rules at all—instead they allow the child to choose his bedtime whether on vacation or not."

6fba2998-2177-421e-b38e-db3b4c965c24@15,9,4,Stages of Development,356,"Therefore, it's possible that easy children (i.e., social, adaptable, and easy to soothe) tend to elicit warm and responsive parenting, while demanding, irritable, withdrawn children evoke irritation in their parents or cause their parents to withdraw (Sanson &amp; Rothbart, 1995)."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,3,Motivation  describes the wants or needs that direct behavior toward a goal.

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,9,"If so, then you are intrinsically motivated."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,10,"However, if you are here because you want to get a college degree to make yourself more marketable for a high-paying career or to satisfy the demands of your parents, then your motivation is more extrinsic in nature."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,11,"In reality, our motivations are often a mix of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the nature of the mix of these factors might change over time (often in ways that seem counter-intuitive)."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,15,"According to this research, receiving some sort of extrinsic reinforcement (i.e., getting paid) for engaging in behaviors that we enjoy leads to those behaviors being thought of as work no longer providing that same enjoyment."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,16,"As a result, we might spend less time engaging in these reclassified behaviors in the absence of any extrinsic reinforcement."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,21,Baking has become work in a way that changes her motivation to do it ( Figure 10.3 ).
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,22,What Odessa has experienced is called the overjustification effect—intrinsic motivation is diminished when extrinsic motivation is given.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,23,"This can lead to extinguishing the intrinsic motivation and creating a dependence on extrinsic rewards for continued performance (Deci et al., 1999)."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,27,These apparent discrepancies in the researchers' findings may be understood by considering several factors.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,28,"For one, physical reinforcement (such as money) and verbal reinforcement (such as praise) may affect an individual in very different ways."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,29,"In fact, tangible rewards (i.e., money) tend to have more negative effects on intrinsic motivation than do intangible rewards (i.e., praise)."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,30,"Furthermore, the expectation of the extrinsic motivator by an individual is crucial: If the person expects to receive an extrinsic reward, then intrinsic motivation for the task tends to be reduced."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,31,"If, however, there is no such expectation, and the extrinsic motivation is presented as a surprise, then intrinsic motivation for the task tends to persist (Deci et al., 1999)."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,32,"In educational settings, students are more likely to experience intrinsic motivation to learn when they feel a sense of belonging and respect in the classroom."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,33,This internalization can be enhanced if the evaluative aspects of the classroom are de-emphasized and if students feel that they exercise some control over the learning environment.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,34,"Furthermore, providing students with activities that are challenging, yet doable, along with a rationale for engaging in various learning activities can enhance intrinsic motivation for those tasks (Niemiec &amp; Ryan, 2009)."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,35,"Consider Hakim, a first-year law student with two courses this semester: Family Law and Criminal Law."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,36,"The Family Law professor has a rather intimidating classroom: He likes to put students on the spot with tough questions, which often leaves students feeling belittled or embarrassed."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,37,"Grades are based exclusively on quizzes and exams, and the instructor posts results of each test on the classroom door."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,38,"In contrast, the Criminal Law professor facilitates classroom discussions and respectful debates in small groups."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,39,"The majority of the course grade is not exam-based, but centers on a student-designed research project on a crime issue of the student's choice."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,40,"Research suggests that Hakim will be less intrinsically motivated in his Family Law course, where students are intimidated in the classroom setting, and there is an emphasis on teacher-driven evaluations."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,41,"Hakim is likely to experience a higher level of intrinsic motivation in his Criminal Law course, where the class setting encourages inclusive collaboration and a respect for ideas, and where students have more influence over their learning activities."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,42,"Theories About Motivation  William  James  (1842–1910) was an important contributor to early research into motivation, and he is often referred to as the father of psychology in the United States."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,43,"James theorized that behavior was driven by a number of instincts, which aid survival ( Figure 10.4 )."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,44,"From a biological perspective, an  instinct  is a species-specific pattern of behavior that is not learned."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,45,"There was, however, considerable controversy among James and his contemporaries over the exact definition of instinct."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,46,"James proposed several dozen special human instincts, but many of his contemporaries had their own lists that differed."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,47,"A mother's protection of her baby, the urge to lick sugar, and hunting prey were among the human behaviors proposed as true instincts during James's era."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,48,This view—that human behavior is driven by instincts—received a fair amount of criticism because of the undeniable role of learning in shaping all sorts of human behavior.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,49,"In fact, as early as the 1900s, some instinctive behaviors were experimentally demonstrated to result from associative learning (recall when you learned about Watson's conditioning of fear response in ""Little Albert"") (Faris, 1921)."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,50,"Figure   10.4        (a) William James proposed the instinct theory of motivation, asserting that behavior is driven by instincts."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,52,Another early theory of motivation proposed that the maintenance of homeostasis is particularly important in directing behavior.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,53,"You may recall from your earlier reading that homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a balance, or optimal level, within a biological system."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,54,"In a body system, a control center (which is often part of the brain) receives input from receptors (which are often complexes of neurons)."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,55,The control center directs effectors (which may be other neurons) to correct any imbalance detected by the control center.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,56,"According to the  drive theory  of motivation, deviations from homeostasis create physiological needs."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,57,"These needs result in psychological drive states that direct behavior to meet the need and, ultimately, bring the system back to homeostasis."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,58,"For example, if it's been a while since you ate, your blood sugar levels will drop below normal."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,59,"This low blood sugar will induce a physiological need and a corresponding drive state (i.e., hunger) that will direct you to seek out and consume food ( Figure 10.5 )."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,60,"Eating will eliminate the hunger, and, ultimately, your blood sugar levels will return to normal."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,61,"Interestingly, drive theory also emphasizes the role that habits play in the type of behavioral response in which we engage."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,62,A  habit  is a pattern of behavior in which we regularly engage.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,63,"Once we have engaged in a behavior that successfully reduces a drive, we are more likely to engage in that behavior whenever faced with that drive in the future (Graham &amp; Weiner, 1996)."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,65,Extensions of drive theory take into account levels of arousal as potential motivators.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,66,"As you recall from your study of learning, these theories assert that there is an optimal level of arousal that we all try to maintain ( Figure 10.6 )."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,67,"If we are underaroused, we become bored and will seek out some sort of stimulation."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,68,"On the other hand, if we are overaroused, we will engage in behaviors to reduce our arousal (Berlyne, 1960)."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,69,Most students have experienced this need to maintain optimal levels of arousal over the course of their academic career.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,70,Think about how much stress students experience toward the end of spring semester.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,71,"They feel overwhelmed with seemingly endless exams, papers, and major assignments that must be completed on time."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,72,They probably yearn for the rest and relaxation that awaits them over the extended summer break.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,73,"However, once they finish the semester, it doesn't take too long before they begin to feel bored."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,74,"Generally, by the time the next semester is beginning in the fall, many students are quite happy to return to school."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,75,This is an example of how arousal theory works.

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,78,So what is the optimal level of arousal?
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,79,What level leads to the best performance?
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,80,"Research shows that moderate arousal is generally best; when arousal is very high or very low, performance tends to suffer (Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1908)."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,91,Albert  Bandura  (1994) theorized that an individual's sense of self-efficacy plays a pivotal role in motivating behavior.
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,92,"Bandura argues that motivation derives from expectations that we have about the consequences of our behaviors, and ultimately, it is the appreciation of our capacity to engage in a given behavior that will determine what we do and the future goals that we set for ourselves."

30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,110,"To Maslow and humanistic theorists, self-actualization reflects the humanistic emphasis on positive aspects of human nature."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,111,"Maslow suggested that this is an ongoing, life-long process and that only a small percentage of people actually achieve a self-actualized state (Francis &amp; Kritsonis, 2006; Maslow, 1943)."
30b003a9-7322-48e0-b624-a8e751f5ae0d@11,10,2,Motivation,112,"According to Maslow (1943), one must satisfy lower-level needs before addressing those needs that occur higher in the pyramid."

b72bcffc-f362-4645-a335-d3a3305eef64@12,10,4,Sexual Behavior,114,"As a result of this work, he developed a theory of psychosexual neutrality."
b72bcffc-f362-4645-a335-d3a3305eef64@12,10,4,Sexual Behavior,115,His theory asserted that we are essentially neutral at birth with regard to our gender identity and that we don't assume a concrete gender identity until we begin to master language.
b72bcffc-f362-4645-a335-d3a3305eef64@12,10,4,Sexual Behavior,116,"Furthermore, Dr. Money believed that the way in which we are socialized in early life is ultimately much more important than our biology in determining our gender identity (Money, 1962)."

09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,13,This section closes with a discussion of the ubiquitous nature of facial expressions of emotion and our abilities to recognize those expressions in others.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,14,"Theories of Emotion               Our emotional states are combinations of physiological arousal, psychological appraisal, and subjective experiences."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,15,"Together, these are known as the  components of emotion ."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,16,"These appraisals are informed by our experiences, backgrounds, and cultures."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,17,"Therefore, different people may have different emotional experiences even when faced with similar circumstances."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,18,"Over time, several different theories of emotion, shown in  Figure 10.21 , have been proposed to explain how the various components of emotion interact with one another."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,19,The  James-Lange theory  of emotion asserts that emotions arise from physiological arousal.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,20,Recall what you have learned about the sympathetic nervous system and our fight or flight response when threatened.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,21,"If you were to encounter some threat in your environment, like a venomous snake in your backyard, your sympathetic nervous system would initiate significant physiological arousal, which would make your heart race and increase your respiration rate."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,22,"According to the James-Lange theory of emotion, you would only experience a feeling of fear after this physiological arousal had taken place."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,23,"Furthermore, different arousal patterns would be associated with different feelings."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,24,"Other theorists, however, doubted that the physiological arousal that occurs with different types of emotions is distinct enough to result in the wide variety of emotions that we experience."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,25,"Thus, the  Cannon-Bard theory  of emotion was developed."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,26,"According to this view, physiological arousal and emotional experience occur simultaneously, yet independently (Lang, 1994)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,27,"So, when you see the venomous snake, you feel fear at exactly the same time that your body mounts its fight or flight response."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,28,"This emotional reaction would be separate and independent of the physiological arousal, even though they co-occur."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,29,The James-Lange and Cannon-Bard theories have each garnered some empirical support in various research paradigms.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,30,"For instance, Chwalisz, Diener, and Gallagher (1988) conducted a study of the emotional experiences of people who had spinal cord injuries."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,31,"They reported that individuals who were incapable of receiving autonomic feedback because of their injuries still experienced emotion; however, there was a tendency for people with less awareness of autonomic arousal to experience less intense emotions."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,32,"More recently, research investigating the facial feedback hypothesis suggested that suppression of facial expression of emotion lowered the intensity of some emotions experienced by participants (Davis, Senghas, &amp; Ochsner, 2009)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,33,"In both of these examples, neither theory is fully supported because physiological arousal does not seem to be necessary for the emotional experience, but this arousal does appear to be involved in enhancing the intensity of the emotional experience."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,34,The  Schachter-Singer two-factor theory  of emotion is another variation on theories of emotions that takes into account both physiological arousal and the emotional experience.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,35,"According to this theory, emotions are composed of two factors: physiological and cognitive."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,36,"In other words, physiological arousal is interpreted in context to produce the emotional experience."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,37,"In revisiting our example involving the venomous snake in your backyard, the two-factor theory maintains that the snake elicits sympathetic nervous system activation that is labeled as fear given the context, and our experience is that of fear."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,38,"Figure   10.21        This figure illustrates the major assertions of the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard, and Schachter-Singer two-factor theories of emotion."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,39,"It is important to point out that Schachter and Singer believed that physiological arousal is very similar across the different types of emotions that we experience, and therefore, the cognitive appraisal of the situation is critical to the actual emotion experienced."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,40,"In fact, it might be possible to misattribute arousal to an emotional experience if the circumstances were right (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,41,"To test their idea, Schachter and Singer performed a clever experiment."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,42,Male participants were randomly assigned to one of several groups.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,43,"Some of the participants received injections of epinephrine that caused bodily changes that mimicked the fight-or-flight response of the sympathetic nervous system; however, only some of these men were told to expect these reactions as side effects of the injection."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,44,"The other men that received injections of epinephrine were told either that the injection would have no side effects or that it would result in a side effect unrelated to a sympathetic response, such as itching feet or headache."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,45,"After receiving these injections, participants waited in a room with someone else they thought was another subject in the research project."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,46,"In reality, the other person was a confederate of the researcher."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,47,"The confederate engaged in scripted displays of euphoric or angry behavior (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,48,"When those subjects who were told that they should expect to feel symptoms of physiological arousal were asked about any emotional changes that they had experienced related to either euphoria or anger (depending on how their confederate behaved), they reported none."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,49,"However, the men who weren't expecting physiological arousal as a function of the injection were more likely to report that they experienced euphoria or anger as a function of their assigned confederate's behavior."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,50,"While everyone that received an injection of epinephrine experienced the same physiological arousal, only those who were not expecting the arousal used context to interpret the arousal as a change in emotional state (Schachter &amp; Singer, 1962)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,51,Strong emotional responses are associated with strong physiological arousal.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,52,"This has led some to suggest that the signs of physiological arousal, which include increased heart rate, respiration rate, and sweating, might serve as a tool to determine whether someone is telling the truth or not."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,53,The assumption is that most of us would show signs of physiological arousal if we were being dishonest with someone.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,54,"A  polygraph , or lie detector test, measures the physiological arousal of an individual responding to a series of questions."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,55,Someone trained in reading these tests would look for answers to questions that are associated with increased levels of arousal as potential signs that the respondent may have been dishonest on those answers.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,56,"While polygraphs are still commonly used, their validity and accuracy are highly questionable because there is no evidence that lying is associated with any particular pattern of physiological arousal (Saxe &amp; Ben-Shakhar, 1999)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,57,"The relationship between our experiencing of emotions and our cognitive processing of them, and the order in which these occur, remains a topic of research and debate."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,58,Lazarus (1991) developed the  cognitive-mediational theory  that asserts our emotions are determined by our appraisal of the stimulus.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,59,"This appraisal mediates between the stimulus and the emotional response, and it is immediate and often unconscious."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,60,"In contrast to the Schachter-Singer model, the appraisal precedes a cognitive label."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,61,"You will learn more about Lazarus's appraisal concept when you study stress, health, and lifestyle."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,62,Two other prominent views arise from the work of Robert Zajonc and Joseph LeDoux.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,63,"Zajonc asserted that some emotions occur separately from or prior to our cognitive interpretation of them, such as feeling fear in response to an unexpected loud sound (Zajonc, 1998)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,64,"He also believed in what we might casually refer to as a gut feeling—that we can experience an instantaneous and unexplainable like or dislike for someone or something (Zajonc, 1980)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,65,LeDoux also views some emotions as requiring no cognition: some emotions completely bypass contextual interpretation.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,66,"His research into the neuroscience of emotion has demonstrated the amygdala's primary role in fear (Cunha, Monfils, &amp; LeDoux, 2010; LeDoux 1996, 2002)."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,67,A fear stimulus is processed by the brain through one of two paths: from the thalamus (where it is perceived) directly to the amygdala or from the thalamus through the cortex and then to the amygdala.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,68,"The first path is quick, while the second enables more processing about details of the stimulus."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,69,"In the following section, we will look more closely at the neuroscience of emotional response."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,70,"The Biology of Emotions  Earlier, you learned about the  limbic system , which is the area of the brain involved in emotion and memory ( Figure 10.22 )."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,71,"The limbic system includes the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, and the hippocampus."
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,72,The hypothalamus plays a role in the activation of the sympathetic nervous system that is a part of any given emotional reaction.
09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,73,The thalamus serves as a sensory relay center whose neurons project to both the amygdala and the higher cortical regions for further processing.

09636efc-5f70-477f-8872-c1841382e52d@16,10,5,Emotion,86,This leads to an aversion to the odor cue that suggests the rats learned to fear the odor cue.

6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,24,He developed a list of traits that could be used to describe the personality of a person from each of the four temperaments.
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,25,"However, Wundt suggested that a better description of personality could be achieved using two major axes: emotional/nonemotional and changeable/unchangeable."
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,26,The first axis separated strong from weak emotions (the melancholic and choleric temperaments from the phlegmatic and sanguine).
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,27,"The second axis divided the changeable temperaments (choleric and sanguine) from the unchangeable ones (melancholic and phlegmatic) (Eysenck, 2009)."

6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,29,Wundt later suggested the arrangement of the traits on two major axes.
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,30,"Sigmund Freud's psychodynamic perspective of personality was the first comprehensive theory of personality, explaining a wide variety of both normal and abnormal behaviors."
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,31,"According to Freud, unconscious drives influenced by sex and aggression, along with childhood sexuality, are the forces that influence our personality."
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,32,Freud  attracted many followers who modified his ideas to create new theories about personality.
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,33,"These theorists, referred to as neo-Freudians, generally agreed with Freud that childhood experiences matter, but they reduced the emphasis on sex and focused more on the social environment and effects of culture on personality."
6098d267-5492-4f0b-b702-ddf1b83e6049@12,11,2,,34,The perspective of personality proposed by Freud and his followers was the dominant theory of personality for the first half of the 20th century.

2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,2,"When reading Freud's theories, it is important to remember that he was a medical doctor, not a psychologist."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,3,"There was no such thing as a degree in psychology at the time that he received his education, which can help us understand some of the controversy over his theories today."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,4,"However, Freud was the first to systematically study and theorize the workings of the unconscious mind in the manner that we associate with modern psychology."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,5,"In the early years of his career, Freud worked with Josef Breuer, a Viennese physician."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,6,"During this time, Freud became intrigued by the story of one of Breuer's patients, Bertha Pappenheim, who was referred to by the pseudonym Anna O."

2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,8,"Anna O. had been caring for her dying father when she began to experience symptoms such as partial paralysis, headaches, blurred vision, amnesia, and hallucinations (Launer, 2005)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,9,"In Freud's day, these symptoms were commonly referred to as hysteria."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,10,Anna O. turned to Breuer for help.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,11,He spent 2 years (1880–1882) treating Anna O. and discovered that allowing her to talk about her experiences seemed to bring some relief of her symptoms.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,12,"Anna O. called his treatment the ""talking cure"" (Launer, 2005)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,13,"Despite the fact the Freud never met Anna O., her story served as the basis for the 1895 book,  Studies on Hysteria , which he co-authored with Breuer."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,14,Based on Breuer's description of Anna O.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,15,"'s treatment, Freud concluded that hysteria was the result of sexual abuse in childhood and that these traumatic experiences had been hidden from consciousness."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,16,"Breuer disagreed with Freud, which soon ended their work together."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,17,"However, Freud continued to work to refine talk therapy and build his theory on personality."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,18,"Levels of Consciousness  To explain the concept of conscious versus unconscious experience, Freud compared the mind to an iceberg ( Figure 11.5 )."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,19,"He said that only about one-tenth of our mind is  conscious , and the rest of our mind is  unconscious ."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,20,"Our unconscious refers to that mental activity of which we are unaware and are unable to access (Freud, 1923)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,21,"According to Freud, unacceptable urges and desires are kept in our unconscious through a process called repression."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,22,"For example, we sometimes say things that we don't intend to say by unintentionally substituting another word for the one we meant."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,23,"You've probably heard of a Freudian slip, the term used to describe this."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,24,"Freud suggested that slips of the tongue are actually sexual or aggressive urges, accidentally slipping out of our unconscious."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,25,Speech errors such as this are quite common.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,26,"Seeing them as a reflection of unconscious desires, linguists today have found that slips of the tongue tend to occur when we are tired, nervous, or not at our optimal level of cognitive functioning (Motley, 2002)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,27,Figure   11.5        Freud believed that we are only aware of a small amount of our mind's activities and that most of it remains hidden from us in our unconscious.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,28,"The information in our unconscious affects our behavior, although we are unaware of it."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,29,"According to Freud, our personality develops from a conflict between two forces: our biological aggressive and pleasure-seeking drives versus our internal (socialized) control over these drives."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,30,Our personality is the result of our efforts to balance these two competing forces.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,31,Freud suggested that we can understand this by imagining three interacting systems within our minds.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,32,"He called them the id, ego, and superego ( Figure 11.6 )."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,33,"Figure   11.6        The job of the ego, or self, is to balance the aggressive/pleasure-seeking drives of the id with the moral control of the superego."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,34,"The unconscious  id  contains our most primitive drives or urges, and is present from birth."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,35,"It directs impulses for hunger, thirst, and sex."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,36,"Freud believed that the id operates on what he called the ""pleasure principle,"" in which the id seeks immediate gratification."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,37,"Through social interactions with parents and others in a child's environment, the ego and superego develop to help control the id."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,38,"The  superego  develops as a child interacts with others, learning the social rules for right and wrong."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,39,The superego acts as our conscience; it is our moral compass that tells us how we should behave.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,40,"It strives for perfection and judges our behavior, leading to feelings of pride or—when we fall short of the ideal—feelings of guilt."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,41,"In contrast to the instinctual id and the rule-based superego, the  ego  is the rational part of our personality."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,42,"It's what Freud considered to be the self, and it is the part of our personality that is seen by others."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,43,"Its job is to balance the demands of the id and superego in the context of reality; thus, it operates on what Freud called the ""reality principle."""
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,44,The ego helps the id satisfy its desires in a realistic way.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,45,"The id and superego are in constant conflict, because the id wants instant gratification regardless of the consequences, but the superego tells us that we must behave in socially acceptable ways."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,46,"Thus, the ego's job is to find the middle ground."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,47,It helps satisfy the id's desires in a rational way that will not lead us to feelings of guilt.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,48,"According to Freud, a person who has a strong ego, which can balance the demands of the id and the superego, has a healthy personality."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,49,"Freud maintained that imbalances in the system can lead to  neurosis  (a tendency to experience negative emotions), anxiety disorders, or unhealthy behaviors."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,50,"For example, a person who is dominated by their id might be narcissistic and impulsive."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,51,"A person with a dominant superego might be controlled by feelings of guilt and deny themselves even socially acceptable pleasures; conversely, if the superego is weak or absent, a person might become a psychopath."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,52,"An overly dominant superego might be seen in an over-controlled individual whose rational grasp on reality is so strong that they are unaware of their emotional needs, or, in a neurotic who is overly defensive (overusing ego defense mechanisms)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,53,Defense Mechanisms  Freud believed that feelings of anxiety result from the ego's inability to mediate the conflict between the id and superego.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,54,"When this happens, Freud believed that the ego seeks to restore balance through various protective measures known as defense mechanisms ( Figure 11.7 )."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,55,"When certain events, feelings, or yearnings cause an individual anxiety, the individual wishes to reduce that anxiety."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,56,"To do that, the individual's unconscious mind uses ego  defense mechanisms , unconscious protective behaviors that aim to reduce anxiety."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,57,"The ego, usually conscious, resorts to unconscious strivings to protect the ego from being overwhelmed by anxiety."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,58,"When we use defense mechanisms, we are unaware that we are using them."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,59,"Further, they operate in various ways that distort reality."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,60,"According to Freud, we all use ego defense mechanisms."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,61,Figure   11.7        Defense mechanisms are unconscious protective behaviors that work to reduce anxiety.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,62,"While everyone uses defense mechanisms, Freud believed that overuse of them may be problematic."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,63,"For example, let's say Joe Smith is a high school football player."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,64,"Deep down, Joe feels sexually attracted to males."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,65,"His conscious belief is that being gay is immoral and that if he were gay, his family would disown him and he would be ostracized by his peers."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,66,"Therefore, there   is a conflict between his conscious beliefs (being gay is wrong and will result in being ostracized) and his unconscious urges (attraction to males)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,67,The idea that he might be gay causes Joe to have feelings of anxiety.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,68,How can he decrease his anxiety?
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,69,"Joe may find himself acting very ""macho,"" making gay jokes, and picking on a school peer who is gay."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,70,"This way, Joe's unconscious impulses are further submerged."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,71,There are several different types of defense mechanisms.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,72,"For instance, in repression, anxiety-causing memories from consciousness are blocked."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,73,"As an analogy, let's say your car is making a strange noise, but because you do not have the money to get it fixed, you just turn up the radio so that you no longer hear the strange noise."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,74,Eventually you forget about it.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,75,"Similarly, in the human psyche, if a memory is too overwhelming to deal with, it might be  repressed  and thus removed from conscious awareness (Freud, 1920)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,76,This repressed memory might cause symptoms in other areas.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,77,"Another defense mechanism is  reaction formation , in which someone expresses feelings, thoughts, and behaviors opposite to their inclinations."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,78,"In the above example, Joe made fun of a homosexual peer while himself being attracted to males."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,79,"In  regression , an individual acts much younger than their age."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,80,"For example, a four-year-old child who resents the arrival of a newborn sibling may act like a baby and revert to drinking out of a bottle."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,81,"In  projection , a person refuses to acknowledge her own unconscious feelings and instead sees those feelings in someone else."

2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,84,Stages of Psychosexual Development  Freud believed that personality develops during early childhood: Childhood experiences shape our personalities as well as our behavior as adults.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,85,He asserted that we develop via a series of stages during childhood.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,86,"Each of us must pass through these childhood stages, and if we do not have the proper nurturing and parenting during a stage, we will be stuck, or fixated, in that stage, even as adults."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,87,"In each  psychosexual stage of development , the child's pleasure-seeking urges, coming from the id, are focused on a different area of the body, called an erogenous zone."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,88,"The stages are oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital ( Table 11.1 )."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,89,Freud's psychosexual development theory is quite controversial.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,90,"To understand the origins of the theory, it is helpful to be familiar with the political, social, and cultural influences of Freud's day in Vienna at the turn of the 20th century."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,91,"During this era, a climate of sexual repression, combined with limited understanding and education surrounding human sexuality, heavily influenced Freud's perspective."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,92,"Given that sex was a taboo topic, Freud assumed that negative emotional states (neuroses) stemmed from suppression of unconscious sexual and aggressive urges."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,93,"For Freud, his own recollections and interpretations of patients' experiences and dreams were sufficient proof that psychosexual stages were universal events in early childhood."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,94,"Stage   Age (years)   Erogenous Zone   Major Conflict   Adult Fixation Example          Oral   0–1   Mouth   Weaning off breast or bottle   Smoking, overeating       Anal   1–3   Anus   Toilet training   Neatness, messiness       Phallic   3–6   Genitals   Oedipus/Electra complex   Vanity, overambition       Latency   6–12   None   None   None        Genital   12+   Genitals   None   None        Table   11.1      Freud's Stages of Psychosexual Development        Oral Stage   In the  oral stage  (birth to 1 year), pleasure is focused on the mouth."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,95,"Eating and the pleasure derived from sucking (nipples, pacifiers, and thumbs) play a large part in a baby's first year of life."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,96,"At around 1 year of age, babies are weaned from the bottle or breast, and this process can create conflict if not handled properly by caregivers."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,97,"According to Freud, an adult who smokes, drinks, overeats, or bites her nails is fixated in the oral stage of her psychosexual development; she may have been weaned too early or too late, resulting in these fixation tendencies, all of which seek to ease anxiety."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,98,"Anal Stage   After passing through the oral stage, children enter what Freud termed the  anal stage  (1–3 years)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,99,"In this stage, children experience pleasure in their bowel and bladder movements, so it makes sense that the conflict in this stage is over toilet training."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,100,Freud suggested that success at the anal stage depended on how parents handled toilet training.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,101,Parents who offer praise and rewards encourage positive results and can help children feel competent.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,102,"Parents who are harsh in toilet training can cause a child to become fixated at the anal stage, leading to the development of an anal-retentive personality."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,103,"The anal-retentive personality is stingy and stubborn, has a compulsive need for order and neatness, and might be considered a perfectionist."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,104,"If parents are too lenient in toilet training, the child might also become fixated and display an anal-expulsive personality."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,105,"The anal-expulsive personality is messy, careless, disorganized, and prone to emotional outbursts."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,106,"Phallic Stage   Freud's third stage of psychosexual development is the  phallic stage  (3–6 years), corresponding to the age when children become aware of their bodies and recognize the differences between boys and girls."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,107,The erogenous zone in this stage is the genitals.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,108,"Conflict arises when the child feels a desire for the opposite-sex parent, and jealousy and hatred toward the same-sex parent."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,109,"For boys, this is called the Oedipus complex, involving a boy's desire for his mother and his urge to replace his father who is seen as a rival for the mother's attention."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,110,"At the same time, the boy is afraid his father will punish him for his feelings, so he experiences  castration anxiety ."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,111,The Oedipus complex is successfully resolved when the boy begins to identify with his father as an indirect way to have the mother.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,112,Failure to resolve the Oedipus complex may result in fixation and development of a personality that might be described as vain and overly ambitious.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,113,Girls experience a comparable conflict in the phallic stage—the Electra complex.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,114,"The Electra complex, while often attributed to Freud, was actually proposed by Freud's protégé, Carl Jung (Jung &amp; Kerenyi, 1963)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,115,A girl desires the attention of her father and wishes to take her mother's place.
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,116,Jung also said that girls are angry with the mother for not providing them with a penis—hence the term  penis envy .
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,117,"While Freud initially embraced the Electra complex as a parallel to the Oedipus complex, he later rejected it, yet it remains as a cornerstone of Freudian theory, thanks in part to academics in the field (Freud, 1931/1968; Scott, 2005)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,118,Latency Period   Following the phallic stage of psychosexual development is a period known as the  latency period  (6 years to puberty).
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,119,"This period is not considered a stage, because sexual feelings are dormant as children focus on other pursuits, such as school, friendships, hobbies, and sports."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,120,"Children generally engage in activities with peers of the same sex, which serves to consolidate a child's gender-role identity."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,121,Genital Stage   The final stage is the  genital stage  (from puberty on).
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,122,"In this stage, there is a sexual reawakening as the incestuous urges resurface."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,123,"The young person redirects these urges to other, more socially acceptable partners (who often resemble the other-sex parent)."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,124,"People in this stage have mature sexual interests, which for Freud meant a strong desire for the opposite sex."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,125,"Individuals who successfully completed the previous stages, reaching the genital stage with no fixations, are said to be well-balanced, healthy adults."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,126,"While most of Freud's ideas have not found support in modern research, we cannot discount the contributions that Freud has made to the field of psychology."
2ae07a37-ed2e-4a2f-8ff7-2f27c5bd5de5@16,11,3,Freud and the Psychodynamic Perspective,127,It was Freud who pointed out that a large part of our mental life is influenced by the experiences of early childhood and takes place outside of our conscious awareness; his theories paved the way for others.

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,5,"He subsequently founded a school of psychology called  individual psychology , which focuses on our drive to compensate for feelings of inferiority."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,6,"Adler (1937, 1956) proposed the concept of the  inferiority complex ."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,7,An inferiority complex refers to a person's feelings that they lack worth and don't measure up to the standards of others or of society.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,8,Adler's ideas about inferiority represent a major difference between his thinking and Freud's.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,9,"Freud believed that we are motivated by sexual and aggressive urges, but Adler (1930, 1961) believed that feelings of inferiority in childhood are what drive people to attempt to gain superiority and that this striving is the force behind all of our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,10,Figure   11.8        Alfred Adler proposed the concept of the inferiority complex.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,11,"Adler also believed in the importance of social connections, seeing childhood development emerging through social development rather than the sexual stages Freud outlined."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,12,Adler noted the inter-relatedness of humanity and the need to work together for the betterment of all.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,13,"He said, ""The happiness of mankind lies in working together, in living as if each individual had set himself the task of contributing to the common welfare"" (Adler, 1964, p. 255) with the main goal of psychology being ""to recognize the equal rights and equality of others"" (Adler, 1961, p. 691)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,14,"With these ideas, Adler identified three fundamental social tasks that all of us must experience: occupational tasks (careers), societal tasks (friendship), and love tasks (finding an intimate partner for a long-term relationship)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,15,"Rather than focus on sexual or aggressive motives for behavior as Freud did, Adler focused on social motives."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,16,"He also emphasized conscious rather than unconscious motivation, since he believed that the three fundamental social tasks are explicitly known and pursued."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,17,That is not to say that Adler did not also believe in unconscious processes—he did—but he felt that conscious processes were more important.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,18,One of Adler's major contributions to personality psychology was the idea that our birth order shapes our personality.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,19,"He proposed that older siblings, who start out as the focus of their parents' attention but must share that attention once a new child joins the family, compensate by becoming overachievers."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,20,"The youngest children, according to Adler, may be spoiled, leaving the middle child with the opportunity to minimize the negative dynamics of the youngest and oldest children."

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,25,It was Anna Freud who encouraged Erikson to study psychoanalysis.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,26,"Erikson received his diploma from the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute in 1933, and as Nazism spread across Europe, he fled the country and immigrated to the United States that same year."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,27,"As you learned when you studied lifespan development, Erikson later proposed a psychosocial theory of development, suggesting that an individual's personality develops throughout the lifespan—a departure from Freud's view that personality is fixed in early life."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,28,"In his theory, Erikson emphasized the social relationships that are important at each stage of personality development, in contrast to Freud's emphasis on sex."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,29,"Erikson identified eight stages, each of which represents a conflict or developmental task ( Table 11.2 )."

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,32,"The focus of analytical psychology is on working to balance opposing forces of conscious and unconscious thought, and experience within one's personality."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,33,"According to Jung, this work is a continuous learning process—mainly occurring in the second half of life—of becoming aware of unconscious elements and integrating them into consciousness."

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,35,Jung's split from Freud was based on two major disagreements.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,36,"First, Jung, like Adler and Erikson, did not accept that sexual drive was the primary motivator in a person's mental life."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,37,"Second, although Jung agreed with Freud's concept of a personal unconscious, he thought it to be incomplete."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,38,"In addition to the personal unconscious, Jung focused on the collective unconscious."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,39,"The  collective unconscious  is a universal version of the personal unconscious, holding mental patterns, or memory traces, which are common to all of us (Jung, 1928)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,40,"These ancestral memories, which Jung called  archetypes , are represented by universal themes in various cultures, as expressed through literature, art, and dreams (Jung)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,41,"Jung said that these themes reflect common experiences of people the world over, such as facing death, becoming independent, and striving for mastery."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,42,"Jung (1964) believed that through biology, each person is handed down the same themes and that the same types of symbols—such as the hero, the maiden, the sage, and the trickster—are present in the folklore and fairy tales of every culture."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,43,"In Jung's view, the task of integrating these unconscious archetypal aspects of the self is part of the self-realization process in the second half of life."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,44,"With this orientation toward self-realization, Jung parted ways with Freud's belief that personality is determined solely by past events and anticipated the humanistic movement with its emphasis on self-actualization and orientation toward the future."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,45,"Jung also proposed two attitudes or approaches toward life: extroversion and introversion (Jung, 1923) ( Table 11.3 )."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,46,"These ideas are considered Jung's most important contributions to the field of personality psychology, as almost all models of personality now include these concepts."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,47,"If you are an extrovert, then you are a person who is energized by being outgoing and socially oriented: You derive your energy from being around others."

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,49,Jung believed a balance between extroversion and introversion best served the goal of self-realization.

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,51,"According to Jung, we consciously create this persona; however, it is derived from both our conscious experiences and our collective unconscious."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,52,What is the purpose of the persona?
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,53,Jung believed that it is a compromise between who we really are (our true self) and what society expects us to be.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,54,We hide those parts of ourselves that are not aligned with society's expectations.

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,56,"This questionnaire describes a person's degree of introversion versus extroversion, thinking versus feeling, intuition versus sensation, and judging versus perceiving."

b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,58,Connect the Concepts     Are Archetypes Genetically Based?
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,59,Jung proposed that human responses to archetypes are similar to instinctual responses in animals.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,60,"One criticism of Jung is that there is no evidence that archetypes are biologically based or similar to animal instincts (Roesler, 2012)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,61,"Jung formulated his ideas about 100 years ago, and great advances have been made in the field of genetics since that time."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,62,"We've found that human babies are born with certain capacities, including the ability to acquire language."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,63,"However, we've also found that symbolic information (such as archetypes) is not encoded on the genome and that babies cannot decode symbolism, refuting the idea of a biological basis to archetypes."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,64,"Rather than being seen as purely biological, more recent research suggests that archetypes emerge directly from our experiences and are reflections of linguistic or cultural characteristics (Young-Eisendrath, 1995)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,65,"Today, most Jungian scholars believe that the collective unconscious and archetypes are based on both innate and environmental influences, with the differences being in the role and degree of each (Sotirova-Kohli et al., 2013)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,66,Karen Horney    Karen  Horney  was one of the first women trained as a Freudian psychoanalyst.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,67,"During the Great Depression, Horney moved from Germany to the United States, and subsequently moved away from Freud's teachings."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,68,"Like Jung, Horney believed that each individual has the potential for self-realization and that the goal of psychoanalysis should be moving toward a healthy self rather than exploring early childhood patterns of dysfunction."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,69,Horney also disagreed with the Freudian idea that girls have penis envy and are jealous of male biological features.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,70,"According to Horney, any jealousy is most likely culturally based, due to the greater privileges that males often have, meaning that the differences between men's and women's personalities are culturally based, not biologically based."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,71,"She further suggested that men have womb envy, because they cannot give birth."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,72,Horney's theories focused on the role of unconscious anxiety.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,73,"She suggested that normal growth can be blocked by basic anxiety stemming from needs not being met, such as childhood experiences of loneliness and/or isolation."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,74,How do children learn to handle this anxiety?
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,75,Horney suggested three styles of coping ( Table 11.4 ).
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,76,"The first coping style,  moving toward people , relies on affiliation and dependence."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,77,"These children become dependent on their parents and other caregivers in an effort to receive attention and affection, which provides relief from anxiety (Burger, 2008)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,78,"When these children grow up, they tend to use this same coping strategy to deal with relationships, expressing an intense need for love and acceptance (Burger, 2008)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,79,"The second coping style,  moving against people , relies on aggression and assertiveness."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,80,"Children with this coping style find that fighting is the best way to deal with an unhappy home situation, and they deal with their feelings of insecurity by bullying other children (Burger, 2008)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,81,"As adults, people with this coping style tend to lash out with hurtful comments and exploit others (Burger, 2008)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,82,"The third coping style,  moving away from people , centers on detachment and isolation."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,83,These children handle their anxiety by withdrawing from the world.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,84,They need privacy and tend to be self-sufficient.
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,85,"When these children are adults, they continue to avoid such things as love and friendship, and they also tend to gravitate toward careers that require little interaction with others (Burger, 2008)."
b1ae7f5f-87fc-4b3c-afe9-88802f44514b@12,11,4,,86,"Coping Style    Description   Example          Moving toward people   Affiliation and dependence    Child seeking positive attention and affection from parent; adult needing love       Moving against people   Aggression and manipulation   Child fighting or bullying other children; adult who is abrasive and verbally hurtful, or who exploits others       Moving away from people   Detachment and isolation   Child withdrawn from the world and isolated; adult loner        Table   11.4      Horney's Coping Styles      Horney believed these three styles are ways in which people typically cope with day-to-day problems; however, the three coping styles can become neurotic strategies if they are used rigidly and compulsively, leading a person to become alienated from others."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,2,"This illustrates one significant advantage of the learning approaches over psychodynamics: Because learning approaches involve observable, measurable phenomena, they can be scientifically tested."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,3,The Behavioral Perspective   Behaviorists do not believe in biological determinism: They do not see personality traits as inborn.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,4,"Instead, they view personality as significantly shaped by the reinforcements and consequences outside of the organism."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,5,"In other words, people behave in a consistent manner based on prior learning."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,6,"B. F.  Skinner , a strict behaviorist, believed that environment was solely responsible for all behavior, including the enduring, consistent behavior patterns studied by personality theorists."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,7,"As you may recall from your study on the psychology of learning, Skinner proposed that we demonstrate consistent behavior patterns because we have developed certain response tendencies (Skinner, 1953)."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,8,"In other words, we  learn  to behave in particular ways."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,9,"We increase the behaviors that lead to positive consequences, and we decrease the behaviors that lead to negative consequences."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,10,Skinner disagreed with Freud's idea that personality is fixed in childhood.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,11,"He argued that personality develops over our entire life, not only in the first few years."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,12,"Our responses can change as we come across new situations; therefore, we can expect more variability over time in personality than Freud would anticipate."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,13,"For example, consider a young woman, Greta, a risk taker."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,14,She drives fast and participates in dangerous sports such as hang gliding and kiteboarding.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,15,"But after she gets married and has children, the system of reinforcements and punishments in her environment changes."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,16,"Speeding and extreme sports are no longer reinforced, so she no longer engages in those behaviors."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,17,"In fact, Greta now describes herself as a cautious person."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,18,The Social-Cognitive Perspective   Albert  Bandura  agreed with Skinner that personality develops through  learning .
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,19,"He disagreed, however, with Skinner's strict behaviorist approach to personality development, because he felt that thinking and reasoning are important components of learning."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,20,He presented a  social-cognitive theory  of personality that emphasizes both learning and cognition as sources of individual differences in personality.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,21,"In social-cognitive theory, the concepts of reciprocal determinism, observational learning, and self-efficacy all play a part in personality development."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,22,"Reciprocal Determinism   In contrast to Skinner's idea that the environment alone determines behavior, Bandura (1990) proposed the concept of  reciprocal determinism , in which cognitive processes, behavior, and context all interact, each factor influencing and being influenced by the others simultaneously ( Figure 11.10 )."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,23,"Cognitive processes  refer to all characteristics previously learned, including beliefs, expectations, and personality characteristics."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,25,"Finally, the  context  in which the behavior occurs refers to the environment or situation, which includes rewarding/punishing stimuli."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,29,"In this example, the behavior is bungee jumping."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,30,"Cognitive factors that might influence this behavior include your beliefs and values, and your past experiences with similar behaviors."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,31,"Finally, context refers to the reward structure for the behavior."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,32,"According to reciprocal determinism, all of these factors are in play."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,33,Observational Learning   Bandura's key contribution to learning theory was the idea that much learning is vicarious.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,34,"We learn by observing someone else's behavior and its consequences, which Bandura called observational learning."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,35,He felt that this type of learning also plays a part in the development of our personality.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,36,"Just as we learn individual behaviors, we learn new behavior patterns when we see them performed by other people or models."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,37,"Drawing on the behaviorists' ideas about reinforcement, Bandura suggested that whether we choose to imitate a model's behavior depends on whether we see the model reinforced or punished."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,38,"Through observational learning, we come to learn what behaviors are acceptable and rewarded in our culture, and we also learn to inhibit deviant or socially unacceptable behaviors by seeing what behaviors are punished."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,39,We can see the principles of reciprocal determinism at work in observational learning.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,40,"For example, personal factors determine which behaviors in the environment a person chooses to imitate, and those environmental events in turn are processed cognitively according to other personal factors."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,42,"Self-efficacy  is our level of confidence in our own abilities, developed through our social experiences."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,43,Self-efficacy affects how we approach challenges and reach goals.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,44,"In observational learning, self-efficacy is a cognitive factor that affects which behaviors we choose to imitate as well as our success in performing those behaviors."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,45,"People who have high self-efficacy believe that their goals are within reach, have a positive view of challenges seeing them as tasks to be mastered, develop a deep interest in and strong commitment to the activities in which they are involved, and quickly recover from setbacks."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,46,"Conversely, people with low self-efficacy avoid challenging tasks because they doubt their ability to be successful, tend to focus on failure and negative outcomes, and lose confidence in their abilities if they experience setbacks."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,47,Feelings of self-efficacy can be specific to certain situations.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,48,"For instance, a student might feel confident in her ability in English class but much less so in math class."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,50,"Distinct from self-efficacy, which involves our belief in our own abilities,  locus of control  refers to our beliefs about the power we have over our lives."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,55,"For example, say you didn't spend much time studying for your psychology test and went out to dinner with friends instead."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,56,"When you receive your test score, you see that you earned a D. If you possess an internal locus of control, you would most likely admit that you failed because you didn't spend enough time studying and decide to study more for the next test."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,57,"On the other hand, if you possess an external locus of control, you might conclude that the test was too hard and not bother studying for the next test, because you figure you will fail it anyway."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,65,Mischel found that the data did not support the central principle of the field—that a person's personality traits are consistent across situations.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,66,"His report triggered a decades-long period of self-examination, known as the person-situation debate, among personality psychologists."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,67,Mischel suggested that perhaps we were looking for consistency in the wrong places.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,68,"He found that although behavior was inconsistent across different situations, it was much more consistent within situations—so that a person's behavior in one situation would likely be repeated in a similar one."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,69,"And as you will see next regarding his famous ""marshmallow test,"" Mischel also found that behavior is consistent in equivalent situations across time."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,70,One of Mischel's most notable contributions to personality psychology was his ideas on self-regulation.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,71,"According to Lecci &amp; Magnavita (2013), ""Self-regulation is the process of identifying a goal or set of goals and, in pursuing these goals, using both internal (e.g., thoughts and affect) and external (e.g., responses of anything or anyone in the environment) feedback to maximize goal attainment"" (p. 6.3)."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,72,Self-regulation is also known as will power.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,73,"When we talk about will power, we tend to think of it as the ability to delay gratification."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,74,"For example, Bettina's teenage daughter made strawberry cupcakes, and they looked delicious."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,75,"However, Bettina forfeited the pleasure of eating one, because she is training for a 5K race and wants to be fit and do well in the race."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,76,Would you be able to resist getting a small reward now in order to get a larger reward later?
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,77,This is the question Mischel investigated in his now-classic marshmallow test.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,78,Mischel designed a study to assess self-regulation in young children.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,79,"In the marshmallow study, Mischel and his colleagues placed a preschool child in a room with one marshmallow on the table."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,80,"The child was told that he could either eat the marshmallow now, or wait until the researcher returned to the room and then he could have two marshmallows (Mischel, Ebbesen &amp; Raskoff, 1972)."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,81,This was repeated with hundreds of preschoolers.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,82,What Mischel and his team found was that young children differ in their degree of self-control.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,83,"Mischel and his colleagues continued to follow this group of preschoolers through high school, and what do you think they discovered?"
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,84,The children who had more self-control in preschool (the ones who waited for the bigger reward) were more successful in high school.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,85,"They had higher SAT scores, had positive peer relationships, and were less likely to have substance abuse issues; as adults, they also had more stable marriages (Mischel, Shoda, &amp; Rodriguez, 1989; Mischel et al., 2010)."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,86,"On the other hand, those children who had poor self-control in preschool (the ones who grabbed the one marshmallow) were not as successful in high school, and they were found to have academic and behavioral problems."

6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,89,"For Mischel (1993), people are situation processors."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,90,"The children in the marshmallow test each processed, or interpreted, the rewards structure of that situation in their own way."
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,91,Mischel's approach to personality stresses the importance of both the situation and the way the person perceives the situation.
6d3fe582-ae92-4660-8524-d1ca82f38116@13,11,5,Learning Approaches,92,"Instead of behavior being determined by the situation, people use cognitive processes to interpret the situation and then behave in accordance with that interpretation."

6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,2,"It does not suggest that psychoanalytic, behaviorist, and other points of view are incorrect but argues that these perspectives do not recognize the depth and meaning of human experience, and fail to recognize the innate capacity for self-directed change and transforming personal experiences."
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,3,This perspective focuses on how healthy people develop.
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,4,"One pioneering humanist, Abraham  Maslow , studied people who he considered to be healthy, creative, and productive, including Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and others."
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,5,"Maslow (1950, 1970) found that such people share similar characteristics, such as being open, creative, loving, spontaneous, compassionate, concerned for others, and accepting of themselves."
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,6,"When you studied motivation, you learned about one of the best-known humanistic theories, Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, in which Maslow proposes that human beings have certain needs in common and that these needs must be met in a certain order."
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,7,"The highest need is the need for self-actualization, which is the achievement of our fullest potential."
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,8,Another humanistic theorist was Carl Rogers.
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,9,"One of Rogers's main ideas about personality regards  self-concept , our thoughts and feelings about ourselves."

6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,14,Rogers further divided the self into two categories: the ideal self and the real self.
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,15,The  ideal self  is the person that you would like to be; the  real self  is the person you actually are.
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,16,Rogers focused on the idea that we need to achieve consistency between these two selves.
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,17,"We experience  congruence  when our thoughts about our real self and ideal self are very similar—in other words, when our self-concept is accurate ."
6c34e2a2-96dc-4cbc-a96b-4ad031f29be2@11,11,6,Humanistic Approaches,18,"High congruence leads to a greater sense of self-worth and a healthy, productive life."

06d4f49d-22aa-4ae4-9c3e-207ff8717102@12,11,7,Biological Approaches,44,Perhaps it's because they are quick to anger and don't have the restraint demonstrated by ectomorphs.
06d4f49d-22aa-4ae4-9c3e-207ff8717102@12,11,7,Biological Approaches,45,"Maybe it's because a person with a mesomorphic body type reflects high levels of testosterone, which may lead to more aggressive behavior."

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,6,Early trait theorists tried to describe all human personality traits.
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,7,"For example, one trait theorist, Gordon Allport (Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936), found 4,500 words in the English language that could describe people."

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,10,Cardinal traits are not very common: Few people have personalities dominated by a single trait.
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,11,"Instead, our personalities typically are composed of multiple traits."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,12,"Central traits are those that make up our personalities (such as loyal, kind, agreeable, friendly, sneaky, wild, and grouchy)."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,13,Secondary traits are those that are not quite as obvious or as consistent as central traits.

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,15,"For example, one person gets angry when people try to tickle him; another can only sleep on the left side of the bed; and yet another always orders her salad dressing on the side."

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,18,"However, saying that a trait is either present or absent does not accurately reflect a person's uniqueness, because all of our personalities are actually made up of the same traits; we differ only in the degree to which each trait is expressed."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,19,"Cattell (1957) identified 16 factors or dimensions of personality: warmth, reasoning, emotional stability, dominance, liveliness, rule-consciousness, social boldness, sensitivity, vigilance, abstractedness, privateness, apprehension, openness to change, self-reliance, perfectionism, and tension ( Table 11.5 )."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,20,"He developed a personality assessment based on these 16 factors, called the 16PF."

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,27,They believed personality is largely governed by biology.

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,30,"According to their theory, people high on the trait of extroversion are sociable and outgoing, and readily connect with others, whereas people high on the trait of introversion have a higher need to be alone, engage in solitary behaviors, and limit their interactions with others."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,31,"In the neuroticism/stability dimension, people high on neuroticism tend to be anxious; they tend to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system and, even with low stress, their bodies and emotional state tend to go into a flight-or-fight reaction."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,32,"In contrast, people high on stability tend to need more stimulation to activate their flight-or-fight reaction and are considered more emotionally stable."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,33,"Based on these two dimensions, the Eysencks' theory divides people into four quadrants."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,34,"These quadrants are sometimes compared with the four temperaments described by the Greeks: melancholic, choleric, phlegmatic, and sanguine ( Figure 11.14 )."

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,36,"Later, the Eysencks added a third dimension: psychoticism versus superego control (Eysenck, Eysenck &amp; Barrett, 1985)."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,37,"In this dimension, people who are high on psychoticism tend to be independent thinkers, cold, nonconformists, impulsive, antisocial, and hostile, whereas people who are high on superego control tend to have high impulse control—they are more altruistic, empathetic, cooperative, and conventional (Eysenck, Eysenck &amp; Barrett, 1985)."
56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,38,"While Cattell's 16 factors may be too broad, the Eysenck's two-factor system has been criticized for being too narrow."

56a6a9cf-0b2d-4ae6-8913-2daa69f401f1@10,11,8,Trait Theorists,52,"The fourth trait is agreeableness, which is the tendency to be pleasant, cooperative, trustworthy, and good-natured."

5851318c-0233-498c-9ade-172422d42698@12,11,9,Cultural Understandings of Personality,31,"Since ideas about personality have a Western basis, the cultural-comparative approach seeks to test Western ideas about personality in other cultures to determine whether they can be generalized and if they have cultural validity (Cheung van de Vijver, &amp; Leong, 2011)."
5851318c-0233-498c-9ade-172422d42698@12,11,9,Cultural Understandings of Personality,32,"For example, recall from the previous section on the trait perspective that researchers used the cultural-comparative approach to test the universality of McCrae and Costa's Five Factor Model."

2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,14,This section explores the best known among the many different types of personality tests.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,15,Self-Report Inventories   Self-report inventories are a kind of objective test used to assess personality.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,16,"They typically use multiple-choice items or numbered scales, which represent a range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,17,"They often are called Likert scales after their developer, Rensis Likert (1932) ( Figure 11.17 )."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,18,"Figure   11.17        If you've ever taken a survey, you are probably familiar with Likert-type scale questions."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,19,Most personality inventories employ these types of response scales.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,20,"One of the most widely used personality inventories is the  Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) , first published in 1943, with 504 true/false questions, and updated to the MMPI-2 in 1989, with 567 questions."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,21,"The original MMPI was based on a small, limited sample, composed mostly of Minnesota farmers and psychiatric patients; the revised inventory was based on a more representative, national sample to allow for better standardization."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,22,The MMPI-2 takes 1–2 hours to complete.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,23,"Responses are scored to produce a clinical profile composed of 10 scales: hypochondriasis, depression, hysteria, psychopathic deviance (social deviance), masculinity versus femininity, paranoia, psychasthenia (obsessive/compulsive qualities), schizophrenia, hypomania, and social introversion."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,24,There is also a scale to ascertain risk factors for alcohol abuse.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,25,"In 2008, the test was again revised, using more advanced methods, to the MMPI-2-RF."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,26,This version takes about one-half the time to complete and has only 338 questions ( Figure 11.18 ).
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,27,"Despite the new test's advantages, the MMPI-2 is more established and is still more widely used."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,28,"Typically, the tests are administered by computer."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,29,"Although the MMPI was originally developed to assist in the clinical diagnosis of psychological disorders, it is now also used for occupational screening, such as in law enforcement, and in college, career, and marital counseling (Ben-Porath &amp; Tellegen, 2008)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,30,Figure   11.18        These true/false questions resemble the kinds of questions you would find on the MMPI.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,31,"In addition to clinical scales, the tests also have validity and reliability scales."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,32,Recall the concepts of reliability and validity from your study of psychological research.)
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,33,"One of the validity scales, the Lie Scale (or ""L"" Scale), consists of 15 items and is used to ascertain whether the respondent is ""faking good"" (underreporting psychological problems to appear healthier)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,34,"For example, if someone responds ""yes"" to a number of unrealistically positive items such as ""I have never told a lie,"" they may be trying to ""fake good"" or appear better than they actually are."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,35,"Reliability scales test an instrument's consistency over time, assuring that if you take the MMPI-2-RF today and then again 5 years later, your two scores will be similar."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,36,"Beutler, Nussbaum, and Meredith (1988) gave the MMPI to newly recruited police officers and then to the same police officers 2 years later."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,37,"After 2 years on the job, police officers' responses indicated an increased vulnerability to alcoholism, somatic symptoms (vague, unexplained physical complaints), and anxiety."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,38,"When the test was given an additional 2 years later (4 years after starting on the job), the results suggested  high risk for alcohol-related difficulties."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,39,Projective Tests    Another method for assessment of personality is  projective testing .
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,40,This kind of test relies on one of the defense mechanisms proposed by Freud—projection—as a way to assess unconscious processes.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,41,"During this type of testing, a series of ambiguous cards is shown to the person being tested, who then is encouraged to project his feelings, impulses, and desires onto the cards—by telling a story, interpreting an image, or completing a sentence."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,42,"Many projective tests have undergone standardization procedures (for example, Exner, 2002) and can be used to access whether someone has unusual thoughts or a high level of anxiety, or is likely to become volatile."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,43,"Some examples of projective tests are the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), the Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks test, the TEMAS (Tell-Me-A-Story), and the Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,44,"The  Rorschach Inkblot Test  was developed in 1921 by a Swiss psychologist named Hermann Rorschach (pronounced ""ROAR-shock"")."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,45,It is a series of symmetrical inkblot cards that are presented to a client by a psychologist.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,46,"Upon presentation of each card, the psychologist asks the client, ""What might this be?"""
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,47,"What the test-taker sees reveals unconscious feelings and struggles (Piotrowski, 1987; Weiner, 2003)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,48,"The Rorschach has been standardized using the Exner system and is effective in measuring depression, psychosis, and anxiety."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,49,"A second projective test is the  Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) , created in the 1930s by Henry Murray, an American psychologist, and a psychoanalyst named Christiana Morgan."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,50,A person taking the TAT is shown 8–12 ambiguous pictures and is asked to tell a story about each picture.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,51,"The stories give insight into their social world, revealing hopes, fears, interests, and goals."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,52,"The storytelling format helps to lower a person's resistance divulging unconscious personal details (Cramer, 2004)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,53,"The TAT has been used in clinical settings to evaluate psychological disorders; more recently, it has been used in counseling settings to help clients gain a better understanding of themselves and achieve personal growth."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,54,"Standardization of test administration is virtually nonexistent among clinicians, and the test tends to be modest to low on validity and reliability (Aronow, Weiss, &amp; Rezinkoff, 2001; Lilienfeld, Wood, &amp; Garb, 2000)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,55,"Despite these shortcomings, the TAT has been one of the most widely used projective tests."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,56,"A third projective test is the  Rotter Incomplete Sentence Blank (RISB)  developed by Julian Rotter in 1950 (recall his theory of locus of control, covered earlier in this chapter)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,57,"There are three forms of this test for use with different age groups: the school form, the college form, and the adult form."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,58,The tests include 40 incomplete sentences that people are asked to complete as quickly as possible ( Figure 11.19 ).
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,59,"The average time for completing the test is approximately 20 minutes, as responses are only 1–2 words in length."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,60,"This test is similar to a word association test, and like other types of projective tests, it is presumed that responses will reveal desires, fears, and struggles."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,61,"The RISB is used in screening college students for adjustment problems and in career counseling (Holaday, Smith, &amp; Sherry, 2010; Rotter &amp; Rafferty 1950)."

2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,63,How would you complete these sentences?
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,64,"For many decades, these traditional projective tests have been used in cross-cultural personality assessments."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,65,"However, it was found that test bias limited their usefulness (Hoy-Watkins &amp; Jenkins-Moore, 2008)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,66,"It is difficult to assess the personalities and lifestyles of members of widely divergent ethnic/cultural groups using personality instruments based on data from a single culture or race (Hoy-Watkins &amp; Jenkins-Moore, 2008)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,67,"For example, when the TAT was used with African-American test takers, the result was often shorter story length and low levels of cultural identification (Duzant, 2005)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,68,"Therefore, it was vital to develop other personality assessments that explored factors such as race, language, and level of acculturation (Hoy-Watkins &amp; Jenkins-Moore, 2008)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,69,"To address this need, Robert Williams developed the first culturally specific projective test designed to reflect the everyday life experiences of African Americans (Hoy-Watkins &amp; Jenkins-Moore, 2008)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,70,"The updated version of the instrument is the  Contemporized-Themes Concerning Blacks Test (C-TCB)  (Williams, 1972)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,71,The C-TCB contains 20 color images that show scenes of African-American lifestyles.
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,72,"When the C-TCB was compared with the TAT for African Americans, it was found that use of the C-TCB led to increased story length, higher degrees of positive feelings, and stronger identification with the C-TCB (Hoy, 1997; Hoy-Watkins &amp; Jenkins-Moore, 2008)."
2ec83ba2-1b21-4c28-a019-ca04338891c7@11,11,10,Personality Assessment,73,"The  TEMAS Multicultural Thematic Apperception Test  is another tool designed to be culturally relevant to minority groups, especially Hispanic youths."

856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,24,"We tend to think that people are in control of their own behaviors, and, therefore, any behavior change must be due to something internal, such as their personality, habits, or temperament."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,25,"According to some social psychologists, people tend to overemphasize internal factors as explanations—or attributions—for the behavior of other people."

856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,31,Why did Greg yell at his wife?
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,32,How would someone committing the fundamental attribution error explain Greg's behavior?
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,33,"The most common response is that Greg is a mean, angry, or unfriendly person (his traits)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,34,This is an internal or dispositional explanation.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,35,"However, imagine that Greg was just laid off from his job due to company downsizing."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,36,Would your explanation for Greg's behavior change?
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,37,"Your revised explanation might be that Greg was frustrated and disappointed for losing his job; therefore, he was in a bad mood (his state)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,38,This is now an external or situational explanation for Greg's behavior.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,39,The fundamental attribution error is so powerful that people often overlook obvious situational influences on behavior.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,40,"A classic example was demonstrated in a series of experiments known as the quizmaster study (Ross, Amabile, &amp; Steinmetz, 1977)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,41,Student participants were randomly assigned to play the role of a questioner (the quizmaster) or a contestant in a quiz game.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,42,"Questioners developed difficult questions to which they knew the answers, and they presented these questions to the contestants."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,43,The contestants answered the questions correctly only 4 out of 10 times ( Figure 12.3 ).
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,44,"After the task, the questioners and contestants were asked to rate their own general knowledge compared to the average student."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,45,"Questioners did not rate their general knowledge higher than the contestants, but the contestants rated the questioners' intelligence higher than their own."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,46,"In a second study, observers of the interaction also rated the questioner as having more general knowledge than the contestant."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,47,The obvious influence on performance is the situation.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,48,"The questioners wrote the questions, so of course they had an advantage."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,49,Both the contestants and observers made an internal attribution for the performance.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,50,They concluded that the questioners must be more intelligent than the contestants.

856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,52,"As demonstrated in the example above, the fundamental attribution error is considered a powerful influence in how we explain the behaviors of others."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,53,"However, it should be noted that some researchers have suggested that the fundamental attribution error may not be as powerful as it is often portrayed."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,54,"In fact, a recent review of more than 173 published studies suggests that several factors (e.g., high levels of idiosyncrasy of the character and how well hypothetical events are explained) play a role in determining just how influential the fundamental attribution error is (Malle, 2006)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,55,Is the Fundamental Attribution Error a Universal Phenomenon?
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,56,You may be able to think of examples of the fundamental attribution error in your life.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,57,Do people in all cultures commit the fundamental attribution error?
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,58,Research suggests that they do not.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,59,"People from an  individualistic culture , that is, a culture that focuses on individual achievement and autonomy, have the greatest tendency to commit the fundamental attribution error."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,60,"Individualistic cultures, which tend to be found in western countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, promote a focus on the individual."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,61,"Therefore, a person's disposition is thought to be the primary explanation for her behavior."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,62,"In contrast, people from a  collectivistic culture , that is, a culture that focuses on communal relationships with others, such as family, friends, and community ( Figure 12.4 ), are less likely to commit the fundamental attribution error (Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991; Triandis, 2001)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,63,"Figure   12.4        People from collectivistic cultures, such as some Asian cultures, are more likely to emphasize relationships with others than to focus primarily on the individual."

856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,65,Why do you think this is the case?
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,66,"Collectivistic cultures, which tend to be found in east Asian countries and in Latin American and African countries, focus on the group more than on the individual (Nisbett, Peng, Choi, &amp; Norenzayan, 2001)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,67,"This focus on others provides a broader perspective that takes into account both situational and cultural influences on behavior; thus, a more nuanced explanation of the causes of others' behavior becomes more likely."

856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,70,"So a naïve observer would tend to attribute Greg's hostile behavior to Greg's disposition rather than to the true, situational cause."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,71,Why do you think we underestimate the influence of the situation on the behaviors of others?
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,72,One reason is that we often don't have all the information we need to make a situational explanation for another person's behavior.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,73,The only information we might have is what is observable.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,74,"Due to this lack of information we have a tendency to assume the behavior is due to a dispositional, or internal, factor."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,75,"When it comes to explaining our own behaviors, however, we have much more information available to us."

856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,77,You might say you were very tired or feeling unwell and needed quiet time—a situational explanation.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,78,"The  actor-observer bias  is the phenomenon of attributing other people's behavior to internal factors (fundamental attribution error) while attributing our own behavior to situational forces (Jones &amp; Nisbett, 1971; Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, &amp; Marecek, 1973; Choi &amp; Nisbett, 1998)."

856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,81,"One study on the actor-observer bias investigated reasons male participants gave for why they liked their girlfriend (Nisbett et al., 1973)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,82,"When asked why participants liked their own girlfriend, participants focused on internal, dispositional qualities of their girlfriends (for example, her pleasant personality)."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,83,"The participants' explanations rarely included causes internal to themselves, such as dispositional traits (for example, ""I need companionship."")."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,84,"In contrast, when speculating why a male friend likes his girlfriend, participants were equally likely to give dispositional and external explanations."
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,85,This supports the idea that actors tend to provide few internal explanations but many situational explanations for their own behavior.
856a177a-de8a-404d-890f-aca15a9d0fd9@12,12,2,,86,"In contrast, observers tend to provide more dispositional explanations for a friend's behavior ( Figure 12.5 )."

a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,20,It is very likely that your behavior will be different.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,21,"Perhaps you are more relaxed and outgoing with your family, making jokes and doing silly things."

a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,23,"These are examples of how our social roles influence and often dictate our behavior to the extent that identity and personality can vary with context (that is, in different social groups) (Malloy, Albright, Kenny, Agatstein &amp; Winquist, 1997)."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,24,"Social Norms   As discussed previously, social roles are defined by a culture's shared knowledge of what is expected behavior of an individual in a specific role."

a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,52,"Scripts   Because of social roles, people tend to know what behavior is expected of them in specific, familiar settings."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,53,"A  script  is a person's knowledge about the sequence of events expected in a specific setting (Schank &amp; Abelson, 1977)."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,54,"How do you act on the first day of school, when you walk into an elevator, or are at a restaurant?"
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,55,"For example, at a restaurant in the United States, if we want the server's attention, we try to make eye contact."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,56,"In Brazil, you would make the sound ""psst"" to get the server's attention."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,57,You can see the cultural differences in scripts.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,58,"To an American, saying ""psst"" to a server might seem rude, yet to a Brazilian, trying to make eye contact might not seem an effective strategy."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,59,Scripts are important sources of information to guide behavior in given situations.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,60,Can you imagine being in an unfamiliar situation and not having a script for how to behave?
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,61,This could be uncomfortable and confusing.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,62,How could you find out about social norms in an unfamiliar culture?
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,63,"Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment  The famous  Stanford prison experiment , conducted by social psychologist Philip  Zimbardo  and his colleagues at Stanford University, demonstrated the power of social roles, social norms, and scripts."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,64,"In the summer of 1971, an advertisement was placed in a California newspaper asking for male volunteers to participate in a study about the psychological effects of prison life."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,65,"More than 70 men volunteered, and these volunteers then underwent psychological testing to eliminate candidates who had underlying psychiatric issues, medical issues, or a history of crime or drug abuse."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,66,The pool of volunteers was whittled down to 24 healthy male college students.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,67,Each student was paid $15 per day and was randomly assigned to play the role of either a prisoner or a guard in the study.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,68,"Based on what you have learned about research methods, why is it important that participants were randomly assigned?"
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,69,A mock prison was constructed in the basement of the psychology building at Stanford.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,70,"Participants assigned to play the role of prisoners were ""arrested"" at their homes by Palo Alto police officers, booked at a police station, and subsequently taken to the mock prison."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,71,The experiment was scheduled to run for several weeks.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,72,"To the surprise of the researchers, both the ""prisoners"" and ""guards"" assumed their roles with zeal."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,73,"In fact, on day 2, some of the prisoners revolted, and the guards quelled the rebellion by threatening the prisoners with night sticks."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,74,"In a relatively short time, the guards came to harass the prisoners in an increasingly sadistic manner, through a complete lack of privacy, lack of basic comforts such as mattresses to sleep on, and through degrading chores and late-night counts."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,75,"The prisoners, in turn, began to show signs of severe anxiety and hopelessness—they began tolerating the guards' abuse."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,76,"Even the Stanford professor who designed the study and was the head researcher, Philip Zimbardo, found himself acting as if the prison was real and his role, as prison supervisor, was real as well."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,77,"After only six days, the experiment had to be ended due to the participants' deteriorating behavior."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,78,"Zimbardo explained,    At this point it became clear that we had to end the study."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,79,"We had created an overwhelmingly powerful situation—a situation in which prisoners were withdrawing and behaving in pathological ways, and in which some of the guards were behaving sadistically."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,80,"Even the ""good"" guards felt helpless to intervene, and none of the guards quit while the study was in progress."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,81,"Indeed, it should be noted that no guard ever came late for his shift, called in sick, left early, or demanded extra pay for overtime work."

a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,83,The guards and prisoners enacted their social roles by engaging in behaviors appropriate to the roles: The guards gave orders and the prisoners followed orders.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,84,Social norms require guards to be authoritarian and prisoners to be submissive.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,85,"When prisoners rebelled, they violated these social norms, which led to upheaval."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,86,The specific acts engaged by the guards and the prisoners derived from scripts.
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,87,"For example, guards degraded the prisoners by forcing them do push-ups and by removing all privacy."
a3e2787e-10c1-4e97-be22-0bd93b609b70@11,12,3,,88,Prisoners rebelled by throwing pillows and trashing their cells.

30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,4,We have attitudes for many things ranging from products that we might pick up in the supermarket to people around the world to political policies.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,5,"Typically, attitudes are favorable or unfavorable: positive or negative (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,6,"And, they have three components: an affective component (feelings), a behavioral component (the effect of the attitude on behavior), and a cognitive component (belief and knowledge) (Rosenberg &amp; Hovland, 1960)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,7,"For example, you may hold a positive attitude toward recycling."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,8,"This attitude should result in positive feelings toward recycling (such as ""It makes me feel good to recycle"" or ""I enjoy knowing that I make a small difference in reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills"")."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,9,"Certainly, this attitude should be reflected in our behavior: You actually recycle as often as you can."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,10,"Finally, this attitude will be reflected in favorable thoughts (for example, ""Recycling is good for the environment"" or ""Recycling is the responsible thing to do"")."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,11,"Our attitudes and beliefs are not only influenced by external forces, but also by internal influences that we control."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,12,"Like our behavior, our attitudes and thoughts are not always changed by situational pressures, but they can be consciously changed by our own free will."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,13,In this section we discuss the conditions under which we would want to change our own attitudes and beliefs.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,14,What is Cognitive Dissonance?
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,15,"Social psychologists have documented that feeling good about ourselves and maintaining positive self-esteem is a powerful motivator of human behavior (Tavris &amp; Aronson, 2008)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,16,"In the United States, members of the predominant culture typically think very highly of themselves and view themselves as good people who are above average on many desirable traits (Ehrlinger, Gilovich, &amp; Ross, 2005)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,17,"Often, our behavior, attitudes, and beliefs are affected when we experience a threat to our self-esteem or positive self-image."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,18,"Psychologist Leon Festinger (1957) defined  cognitive dissonance  as psychological discomfort arising from holding two or more inconsistent attitudes, behaviors, or cognitions (thoughts, beliefs, or opinions)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,19,"Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance states that when we experience a conflict in our behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that runs counter to our positive self-perceptions, we experience psychological discomfort (dissonance)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,20,"For example, if you believe smoking is bad for your health but you continue to smoke, you experience conflict between your belief and behavior ( Figure 12.11 )."

30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,23,"To reduce cognitive dissonance, individuals can change their behavior, as in quitting smoking, or change their belief, such as discounting the evidence that smoking is harmful."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,24,.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,25,"Additional research found that dissonance is not only psychologically uncomfortable but also can cause physiological arousal (Croyle &amp; Cooper, 1983) and activate regions of the brain important in emotions and cognitive functioning (van Veen, Krug, Schooler, &amp; Carter, 2009)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,26,"When we experience cognitive dissonance, we are motivated to decrease it because it is psychologically, physically, and mentally uncomfortable."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,27,"We can reduce  cognitive dissonance  by bringing our cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors in line—that is, making them harmonious."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,28,"This can be done in different ways, such as:     changing our discrepant behavior (e.g., stop smoking),   changing our cognitions through rationalization or denial (e.g., telling ourselves that health risks can be reduced by smoking filtered cigarettes),   adding a new cognition (e.g., ""Smoking suppresses my appetite so I don't become overweight, which is good for my health."")."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,29,"A classic example of cognitive dissonance is John, a 20-year-old who enlists in the military."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,30,"During boot camp he is awakened at 5:00 a.m., is chronically sleep deprived, yelled at, covered in sand flea bites, physically bruised and battered, and mentally exhausted ( Figure 12.12 )."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,31,It gets worse.

30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,34,"Not surprisingly, John is miserable."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,35,No one likes to be miserable.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,36,"In this type of situation, people can change their beliefs, their attitudes, or their behaviors."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,37,"The last option, a change of behaviors, is not available to John."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,38,"He has signed on to the military for four years, and he cannot legally leave."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,39,"If John keeps thinking about how miserable he is, it is going to be a very long four years."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,40,He will be in a constant state of cognitive dissonance.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,41,"As an alternative to this misery, John can change his beliefs or attitudes."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,42,"He can tell himself, ""I am becoming stronger, healthier, and sharper."

30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,45,"If this is his belief, he will realize that he is becoming stronger through his challenges."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,46,"He then will feel better and not experience cognitive dissonance, which is an uncomfortable state."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,47,"The Effect of Initiation   The military example demonstrates the observation that a difficult  initiation  into a group influences us to like the group  more , due to the justification of effort."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,48,We do not want to have wasted time and effort to join a group that we eventually leave.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,49,A classic experiment by Aronson and Mills (1959) demonstrated this justification of effort effect.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,50,College students volunteered to join a campus group that would meet regularly to discuss the psychology of sex.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,51,"Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no initiation, an easy initiation, and a difficult initiation into the group."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,52,"After participating in the first discussion, which was deliberately made very boring, participants rated how much they liked the group."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,53,Participants who underwent a difficult initiation process to join the group rated the group more favorably than did participants with an easy initiation or no initiation ( Figure 12.13 ).

30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,55,Students in the difficult initiation condition liked the group more than students in other conditions due to the justification of effort.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,56,Similar effects can be seen in a more recent study of how student effort affects course evaluations.
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,57,"Heckert, Latier, Ringwald-Burton, and Drazen (2006) surveyed 463 undergraduates enrolled in courses at a midwestern university about the amount of effort that their courses required of them."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,58,"In addition, the students were also asked to evaluate various aspects of the course."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,59,"Given what you've just read, it will come as no surprise that those courses that were associated with the highest level of effort were evaluated as being more valuable than those that did not."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,60,"Furthermore, students indicated that they learned more in courses that required more effort, regardless of the grades that they received in those courses (Heckert et al., 2006)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,61,"Besides the classic military example and group initiation, can you think of other examples of  cognitive dissonance ?"
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,62,"Here is one: Marco and Maria live in Fairfield County, Connecticut, which is one of the wealthiest areas in the United States and has a very high cost of living."

30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,68,How does the theory of cognitive dissonance apply to Marco and Maria's choices?
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,69,"Persuasion   In the previous section we discussed that the motivation to reduce cognitive dissonance leads us to change our attitudes, behaviors, and/or cognitions to make them consonant."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,70,Persuasion  is the process of changing our attitude toward something based on some kind of communication.

30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,81,"Hovland demonstrated that certain features of the source of a persuasive message, the content of the message, and the characteristics of the audience will influence the persuasiveness of a message (Hovland, Janis, &amp; Kelley, 1953)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,82,"Features of the source of the persuasive message include the credibility of the speaker (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951) and the physical attractiveness of the speaker (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1975; Petty, Wegener, &amp; Fabrigar, 1997)."
30129bca-b602-49de-ad6d-23c868c999c8@13,12,4,Attitudes and Persuasion,83,"Thus, speakers who are credible, or have expertise on the topic, and who are deemed as trustworthy are more persuasive than less credible speakers."

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,12,Research suggests there are many other reasons.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,13,Altruism  is people's desire to help others even if the costs outweigh the benefits of helping.

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,22,Other researchers argue that altruism is a form of selfless helping that is not motivated by benefits or feeling good about oneself.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,23,"Certainly, after helping, people feel good about themselves, but some researchers argue that this is a consequence of altruism, not a cause."

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,30,This most important factor is proximity.

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,53,Self-disclosure is part of the two way street.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,54,"Self-disclosure  is the sharing of personal information (Laurenceau, Barrett, &amp; Pietromonaco, 1998)."

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,58,"But, what features of a person do we find attractive?"
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,59,"We don't form relationships with everyone that lives or works near us, so how is it that we decide which specific individuals we will select as friends and lovers?"
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,60,Researchers have documented several characteristics in men and women that humans find attractive.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,61,First we look for friends and lovers who are physically attractive.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,62,"People differ in what they consider attractive, and attractiveness is culturally influenced."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,63,"Research, however, suggests that some universally attractive features in women include large eyes, high cheekbones, a narrow jaw line, a slender build (Buss, 1989), and a lower waist-to-hip ratio (Singh, 1993)."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,64,"For men, attractive traits include being tall, having broad shoulders, and a narrow waist (Buss, 1989)."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,65,"Both men and women with high levels of facial and body symmetry are generally considered more attractive than asymmetric individuals (Fink, Neave, Manning, &amp; Grammer, 2006; Penton-Voak et al., 2001; Rikowski &amp; Grammer, 1999)."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,66,"Social traits that people find attractive in potential female mates include warmth, affection, and social skills; in males, the attractive traits include achievement, leadership qualities, and job skills (Regan &amp; Berscheid, 1997)."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,67,"Although humans want mates who are physically attractive, this does not mean that we look for the most attractive person possible."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,68,"In fact, this observation has led some to propose what is known as the matching hypothesis which asserts that people tend to pick someone they view as their equal in physical attractiveness and social desirability (Taylor, Fiore, Mendelsohn, &amp; Cheshire, 2011)."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,69,"For example, you and most people you know likely would say that a very attractive movie star is out of your league."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,70,"So, even if you had proximity to that person, you likely would not ask them out on a date because you believe you likely would be rejected."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,71,People weigh a potential partner's attractiveness against the likelihood of success with that person.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,72,"If you think you are particularly unattractive (even if you are not), you likely will seek partners that are fairly unattractive (that is, unattractive in physical appearance or in behavior)."

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,74,"Robert Sternberg (1986) proposed that there are three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,75,These three components form a triangle that defines multiple types of love: this is known as Sternberg's  triangular theory of love  ( Figure 12.29 ).
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,76,Intimacy is the sharing of details and intimate thoughts and emotions.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,77,Passion is the physical attraction—the flame in the fire.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,78,"Commitment is standing by the person—the ""in sickness and health"" part of the relationship."

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,82,"Other forms of love include liking, which is defined as having intimacy but no passion or commitment."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,83,Infatuation is the presence of passion without intimacy or commitment.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,84,Empty love is having commitment without intimacy or passion.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,85,"Companionate love , which is characteristic of close friendships and family relationships, consists of intimacy and commitment but no passion."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,86,"Romantic love  is defined by having passion and intimacy, but no commitment."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,87,"Finally, fatuous love is defined by having passion and commitment, but no intimacy, such as a long term sexual love affair."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,88,Can you describe other examples of relationships that fit these different types of love?
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,89,"Figure   12.30        According to Sternberg, consummate love describes a healthy relationship containing intimacy, passion, and commitment."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,90,"Social Exchange Theory   We have discussed why we form relationships, what attracts us to others, and different types of love."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,91,But what determines whether we are satisfied with and stay in a relationship?
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,92,One theory that provides an explanation is social exchange theory.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,93,"According to  social exchange theory , we act as naïve economists in keeping a tally of the ratio of costs and benefits of forming and maintaining a relationship with others ( Figure 12.31 ) (Rusbult &amp; Van Lange, 2003)."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,94,"Figure   12.31        Acting like naïve economists, people may keep track of the costs and benefits of maintaining a relationship."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,95,"Typically, only those relationships in which the benefits outweigh the costs will be maintained."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,96,"People are motivated to maximize the benefits of social exchanges, or relationships, and minimize the costs."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,97,"People prefer to have more benefits than costs, or to have nearly equal costs and benefits, but most people are dissatisfied if their social exchanges create more costs than benefits."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,98,Let's discuss an example.
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,99,"If you have ever decided to commit to a romantic relationship, you probably considered the advantages and disadvantages of your decision."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,100,What are the benefits of being in a committed romantic relationship?

428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,103,"You may think that over time boredom from being with only one person may set in; moreover, it may be expensive to share activities such as attending movies and going to dinner."
428c8adb-73d1-4129-a1c1-a71b7ab119da@11,12,8,Prosocial Behavior,104,"However, the benefits of dating your romantic partner presumably outweigh the costs, or you wouldn't continue the relationship."

f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,13,"As a consequence of its concern for candidate characteristics, industrial psychology must also consider issues of legality regarding discrimination in hiring."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,14,Organizational psychology  is a discipline interested in how the relationships among employees affect those employees and the performance of a business.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,15,"This includes studying worker satisfaction, motivation, and commitment."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,16,"This field also studies management, leadership, and organizational culture, as well as how an organization's structures, management and leadership styles, social norms, and role expectations affect individual behavior."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,17,"As a result of its interest in worker wellbeing and relationships, organizational psychology also considers the subjects of harassment, including sexual harassment, and workplace violence."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,18,"Human factors psychology  is the study of how workers interact with the tools of work and how to design those tools to optimize workers' productivity, safety, and health."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,19,"These studies can involve interactions as straightforward as the fit of a desk, chair, and computer to a human having to sit on the chair at the desk using the computer for several hours each day."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,20,They can also include the examination of how humans interact with complex displays and their ability to interpret them accurately and quickly.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,21,"In Europe, this field is referred to as ergonomics."

f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,27,The Historical Development of Industrial and Organizational Psychology   Industrial and organizational psychology had its origins in the early 20th century.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,28,"Several influential early psychologists studied issues that today would be categorized as industrial psychology: James Cattell (1860–1944) at Columbia, Hugo Münsterberg (1863–1916) at Harvard, Walter Dill Scott (1869–1955) at Northwestern, Robert Yerkes (1876–1956) and Walter Bingham (1880–1952) at Dartmouth, and Lillian Gilbreth (1878–1972) at Purdue."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,29,"Cattell, Münsterberg, and Scott had been students of Wilhelm Wundt, the father of experimental psychology."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,30,"Some of these researchers had been involved in work in the area of industrial psychology before World War I. Cattell's contribution to industrial psychology is largely reflected in his founding of a psychological consulting company, which is still operating today called the Psychological Corporation, and in the accomplishments of students at Columbia in the area of industrial psychology."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,31,"In 1913, Münsterberg published  Psychology and Industrial Efficiency , which covered topics such as employee selection, employee training, and effective advertising."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,32,"Scott  was one of the first psychologists to apply psychology to advertising, management, and personnel selection."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,33,"In 1903, Scott published two books:  The Theory of Advertising  and  Psychology of Advertising ."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,34,They are the first books to describe the use of psychology in the business world.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,35,"By 1911 he published two more books,  Influencing Men in Business  and  Increasing Human Efficiency in Business ."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,36,"In 1916 a newly formed division in the Carnegie Institute of Technology hired Scott to conduct applied research on employee selection (Katzell &amp; Austin, 1992)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,37,"The focus of all this research was in what we now know as industrial psychology; it was only later in the century that the field of organizational psychology developed as an experimental science (Katzell &amp; Austin, 1992)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,38,"In addition to their academic positions, these researchers also worked directly for businesses as consultants."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,39,The involvement of the United States in World War I in April 1917 catalyzed the participation in the military effort of psychologists working in this area.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,40,At that time Yerkes was the president of the 25-year-old  American Psychological Association (APA) .
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,41,The APA is a professional association in the United States for clinical and research psychologists.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,42,"Today the APA performs a number of functions including holding conferences, accrediting university degree programs, and publishing scientific journals."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,43,Yerkes organized a group under the Surgeon General's Office (SGO) that developed methods for screening and selecting enlisted men.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,44,They developed the Army Alpha test to measure mental abilities.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,45,The Army Beta test was a non-verbal form of the test that was administered to illiterate and non-English-speaking draftees.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,46,Scott and Bingham organized a group under the Adjutant General's Office (AGO) with the goal to develop selection methods for officers.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,47,"They created a catalogue of occupational needs for the Army, essentially a job-description system and a system of performance ratings and occupational skill tests for officers (Katzell &amp; Austin, 1992)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,48,"After the war, work on personnel selection continued."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,49,"For example, Millicent Pond, who received a PhD from Yale University, worked at several businesses and was director of employment test research at Scoville Manufacturing Company."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,50,"She researched the selection of factory workers, comparing the results of pre-employment tests with various indicators of job performance."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,51,"These studies were published in a series of research articles in the  Journal of Personnel Research  in the late 1920s (Vinchur &amp; Koppes, 2014)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,52,"From 1929 to 1932 Elton Mayo (1880–1949) and his colleagues began a series of studies at a plant near Chicago, Western Electric's Hawthorne Works ( Figure 13.4 )."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,53,"This long-term project took industrial psychology beyond just employee selection and placement to a study of more complex problems of interpersonal relations, motivation, and organizational dynamics."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,54,These studies mark the origin of organizational psychology.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,55,"They began as research into the effects of the physical work environment (e.g., level of lighting in a factory), but the researchers found that the psychological and social factors in the factory were of more interest than the physical factors."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,56,"These studies also examined how human interaction factors, such as supervisorial style, enhanced or decreased productivity."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,57,Figure   13.4        Hawthorne Works provided the setting for several early I-O studies.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,58,"Analysis of the findings by later researchers led to the term the  Hawthorne effect , which describes the increase in performance of individuals who are noticed, watched, and paid attention to by researchers or supervisors  Figure 13.5 )."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,59,"What the original researchers found was that any change in a variable, such as lighting levels, led to an improvement in productivity; this was true even when the change was negative, such as a return to poor lighting."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,60,"The effect faded when the attention faded (Roethlisberg &amp; Dickson, 1939)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,61,The Hawthorne-effect concept endures today as an important experimental consideration in many fields and a factor that has to be controlled for in an experiment.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,62,"In other words, an experimental treatment of some kind may produce an effect simply because it involves greater attention of the researchers on the participants (McCarney et al., 2007)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,63,"Figure   13.5        Researchers discovered that employees performed better when researchers or supervisors observed and interacted with them, a dynamic termed the Hawthorne effect."

f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,65,"In the 1930s, researchers began to study employees' feelings about their jobs."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,66,"Kurt Lewin also conducted research on the effects of various leadership styles, team structure, and team dynamics (Katzell &amp; Austin, 1992)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,67,Lewin is considered the founder of social psychology and much of his work and that of his students produced results that had important influences in organizational psychology.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,68,"Lewin and his students' research included an important early study that used children to study the effect of leadership style on aggression, group dynamics, and satisfaction (Lewin, Lippitt, &amp; White, 1939)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,69,"Lewin was also responsible for coining the term  group dynamics , and he was involved in studies of group interactions, cooperation, competition, and communication that bear on organizational psychology."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,70,"Parallel to these studies in industrial and organizational psychology, the field of human factors psychology was also developing."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,71,Frederick  Taylor  was an engineer who saw that if one could redesign the workplace there would be an increase in both output for the company and wages for the workers.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,72,"In 1911 he put forward his theory in a book titled,  The Principles of Scientific Management  ( Figure 13.6 )."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,73,"His book examines management styles, personnel selection and training, as well as the work itself, using time and motion studies."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,74,"Figure   13.6        (a) Frederick Taylor (1911) strived to engineer workplaces to increase productivity, based on the ideas he set forth in (b) his book,  The Principles of Scientific Management ."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,75,c) Taylor designed this steam hammer at the Midvale Steel Company.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,76,One of the examples of Taylor's theory in action involved workers handling heavy iron ingots.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,77,Taylor showed that the workers could be more productive by taking work rests.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,78,This method of rest increased worker productivity from 12.5 to 47.0 tons moved per day with less reported fatigue as well as increased wages for the workers who were paid by the ton.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,79,"At the same time, the company's cost was reduced from 9.2 cents to 3.9 cents per ton."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,80,"Despite these increases in productivity, Taylor's theory received a great deal of criticism at the time because it was believed that it would exploit workers and reduce the number of workers needed."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,81,"Also controversial was the underlying concept that only a manager could determine the most efficient method of working, and that while at work, a worker was incapable of this."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,82,Taylor's theory was underpinned by the notion that a worker was fundamentally lazy and the goal of Taylor's scientific management approach was to maximize productivity without much concern for worker well-being.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,83,"His approach was criticized by unions and those sympathetic to workers (Van De Water, 1997)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,84,Gilbreth  was another influential I-O psychologist who strove to find ways to increase productivity ( Figure 13.7 ).
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,85,"Using time and motion studies, Gilbreth and her husband, Frank, worked to make workers more efficient by reducing the number of motions required to perform a task."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,86,"She not only applied these methods to industry but also to the home, office, shops, and other areas."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,87,She investigated employee fatigue and time management stress and found many employees were motivated by money and job satisfaction.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,88,"In 1914, Gilbreth wrote the book title,  The Psychology of Management: The Function of the Mind in Determining, Teaching, and Installing Methods of Least Waste , and she is known as the mother of modern management."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,89,"Some of Gilbreth's contributions are still in use today: you can thank her for the idea to put shelves inside on refrigerator doors, and she also came up with the concept of using a foot pedal to operate the lid of trash can (Gilbreth, 1914, 1998; Koppes, 1997; Lancaster, 2004)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,90,"Gilbreth was the first woman to join the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1926, and in 1966 she was awarded the Hoover Medal of the American Society of Civil Engineers."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,91,"Taylor and Gilbreth's work improved productivity, but these innovations also improved the fit between technology and the human using it."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,92,The study of machine–human fit is known as ergonomics or human factors psychology.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,93,"Figure   13.7        (a) Lillian Gilbreth studied efficiency improvements that were applicable in the workplace, home, and other areas."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,94,She is credited with the idea of (b) putting shelves on the inside of refrigerator doors and (c) foot-pedal-operated garbage cans.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,95,From WWII to Today   World War II also drove the expansion of industrial psychology.
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,96,"Bingham was hired as the chief psychologist for the War Department (now the Department of Defense) and developed new systems for job selection, classification, training, ad performance review, plus methods for team development, morale change, and attitude change  (Katzell &amp; Austin, 1992)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,97,"Other countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, likewise saw growth in I-O psychology during World War II (McMillan, Stevens, &amp; Kelloway, 2009)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,98,"In the years after the war, both industrial psychology and organizational psychology became areas of significant research effort."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,99,"Concerns about the fairness of employment tests arose, and the ethnic and gender biases in various tests were evaluated with mixed results."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,100,"In addition, a great deal of research went into studying job satisfaction and employee motivation (Katzell &amp; Austin, 1992)."
f12d3bb8-3209-42cc-9029-a8c395557a7c@12,13,2,,101,"Today, I-O psychology is a diverse and deep field of research and practice, as you will learn about in the rest of this chapter."

d40bc7d6-829c-4c49-ab8c-553b904d1624@13,13,3,Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees,8,The first approach is task-oriented and lists in detail the tasks that will be performed for the job.
d40bc7d6-829c-4c49-ab8c-553b904d1624@13,13,3,Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees,9,"Each task is typically rated on scales for how frequently it is performed, how difficult it is, and how important it is to the job."
d40bc7d6-829c-4c49-ab8c-553b904d1624@13,13,3,Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees,10,The second approach is worker-oriented.
d40bc7d6-829c-4c49-ab8c-553b904d1624@13,13,3,Industrial Psychology: Selecting and Evaluating Employees,11,This approach describes the characteristics required of the worker to successfully perform the job.

a0461bab-6b94-48b8-8b77-d4f71d2b7db5@9,14,1,Chapter Outline,3,Few would deny that today's college students are under a lot of pressure.
a0461bab-6b94-48b8-8b77-d4f71d2b7db5@9,14,1,Chapter Outline,4,"In addition to many usual stresses and strains incidental to the college experience (e.g., exams, term papers, and the dreaded freshman 15), students today are faced with increased college tuitions, burdensome debt, and difficulty finding employment after graduation."
a0461bab-6b94-48b8-8b77-d4f71d2b7db5@9,14,1,Chapter Outline,5,"A significant population of non-traditional college students may face additional stressors, such as raising children or holding down a full-time job while working toward a degree."
a0461bab-6b94-48b8-8b77-d4f71d2b7db5@9,14,1,Chapter Outline,6,"Of course, life is filled with many additional challenges beyond those incurred in college or the workplace."
a0461bab-6b94-48b8-8b77-d4f71d2b7db5@9,14,1,Chapter Outline,7,"We might have concerns with financial security, difficulties with friends or neighbors, family responsibilities, and we may not have enough time to do the things we want to do."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,2,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Differentiate between stimulus-based and response-based definitions of stress   Define stress as a process   Differentiate between good stress and bad stress   Describe the early contributions of Walter Cannon and Hans Selye to the stress research field   Understand the physiological basis of stress and describe the general adaptation syndrome       The term  stress  as it relates to the human condition first emerged in scientific literature in the 1930s, but it did not enter the popular vernacular until the 1970s (Lyon, 2012)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,3,"Today, we often use the term loosely in describing a variety of unpleasant feeling states; for example, we often say we are stressed out when we feel frustrated, angry, conflicted, overwhelmed, or fatigued."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,4,"Despite the widespread use of the term, stress is a fairly vague concept that is difficult to define with precision."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,5,Researchers have had a difficult time agreeing on an acceptable definition of stress.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,6,"Some have conceptualized stress as a demanding or threatening event or situation (e.g., a high-stress job, overcrowding, and long commutes to work)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,7,Such conceptualizations are known as stimulus-based definitions because they characterize stress as a stimulus that causes certain reactions.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,8,"Stimulus-based definitions of stress are problematic, however, because they fail to recognize that people differ in how they view and react to challenging life events and situations."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,9,"For example, a conscientious student who has studied diligently all semester would likely experience less stress during final exams week than would a less responsible, unprepared student."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,10,"Others have conceptualized stress in ways that emphasize the physiological responses that occur when faced with demanding or threatening situations (e.g., increased arousal)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,11,These conceptualizations are referred to as response-based definitions because they describe stress as a response to environmental conditions.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,12,"For example, the endocrinologist Hans  Selye , a famous stress researcher, once defined stress as the ""response of the body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions"" (Selye, 1976, p. 74)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,13,Selye's definition of stress is response-based in that it conceptualizes stress chiefly in terms of the body's physiological reaction to any demand that is placed on it.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,14,Neither stimulus-based nor response-based definitions provide a complete definition of stress.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,15,"Many of the physiological reactions that occur when faced with demanding situations (e.g., accelerated heart rate) can also occur in response to things that most people would not consider to be genuinely stressful, such as receiving unanticipated good news: an unexpected promotion or raise."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,16,"A useful way to conceptualize  stress  is to view it as a process whereby an individual perceives and responds to events that he appraises as overwhelming or threatening to his well-being (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,17,"A critical element of this definition is that it emphasizes the importance of how we appraise—that is, judge—demanding or threatening events (often referred to as  stressors ); these appraisals, in turn, influence our reactions to such events."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,18,Two kinds of appraisals of a stressor are especially important in this regard: primary and secondary appraisals.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,19,A  primary appraisal  involves judgment about the degree of potential harm or threat to well-being that a stressor might entail.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,20,"A stressor would likely be appraised as a threat if one anticipates that it could lead to some kind of harm, loss, or other negative consequence; conversely, a stressor would likely be appraised as a challenge if one believes that it carries the potential for gain or personal growth."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,21,"For example, an employee who is promoted to a leadership position would likely perceive the promotion as a much greater threat if she believed the promotion would lead to excessive work demands than if she viewed it as an opportunity to gain new skills and grow professionally."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,22,"Similarly, a college student on the cusp of graduation may face the change as a threat or a challenge ( Figure 14.2 )."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,25,"As you may recall from what you learned about self-efficacy, an individual's belief in his ability to complete a task is important (Bandura, 1994)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,26,"A threat tends to be viewed as less catastrophic if one believes something can be done about it (Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,27,"Imagine that two middle-aged women, Robin and Maria, perform breast self-examinations one morning and each woman notices a lump on the lower region of her left breast."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,28,"Although both women view the breast lump as a potential threat (primary appraisal), their secondary appraisals differ considerably."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,29,"In considering the breast lump, some of the thoughts racing through Robin's mind are, ""Oh my God, I could have breast cancer!"

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,36,"On the other hand, Maria thinks, ""Hmm, this may not be good."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,37,"Although most times these things turn out to be benign, I need to have it checked out."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,38,"If it turns out to be breast cancer, there are doctors who can take care of it because the medical technology today is quite advanced."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,39,"I'll have a lot of different options, and I'll be just fine."""
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,40,"Clearly, Robin and Maria have different outlooks on what might turn out to be a very serious situation: Robin seems to think that little could be done about it, whereas Maria believes that, worst case scenario, a number of options that are likely to be effective would be available."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,41,"As such, Robin would clearly experience greater stress than would Maria."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,42,"Figure   14.3        When encountering a stressor, a person judges its potential threat (primary appraisal) and then determines if effective options are available to manage the situation."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,43,Stress is likely to result if a stressor is perceived as extremely threatening or threatening with few or no effective coping options available.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,44,"To be sure, some stressors are inherently more stressful than others in that they are more threatening and leave less potential for variation in cognitive appraisals (e.g., objective threats to one's health or safety)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,45,"Nevertheless, appraisal will still play a role in augmenting or diminishing our reactions to such events (Everly &amp; Lating, 2002)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,46,"If a person appraises an event as harmful and believes that the demands imposed by the event exceed the available resources to manage or adapt to it, the person will subjectively experience a state of stress."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,47,"In contrast, if one does not appraise the same event as harmful or threatening, she is unlikely to experience stress."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,48,"According to this definition, environmental events trigger stress reactions by the way they are interpreted and the meanings they are assigned."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,49,"In short, stress is largely in the eye of the beholder: it's not so much what happens to you as it is how you respond (Selye, 1976)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,50,Good Stress?
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,51,"Although stress carries a negative connotation, at times it may be of some benefit."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,52,"Stress can motivate us to do things in our best interests, such as study for exams, visit the doctor regularly, exercise, and perform to the best of our ability at work."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,53,"Indeed, Selye (1974) pointed out that not all stress is harmful."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,54,"He argued that stress can sometimes be a positive, motivating force that can improve the quality of our lives."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,55,"This kind of stress, which Selye called  eustress  (from the Greek  eu  = ""good""), is a good kind of stress associated with positive feelings, optimal health, and performance."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,56,A moderate amount of stress can be beneficial in challenging situations.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,57,"For example, athletes may be motivated and energized by pregame stress, and students may experience similar beneficial stress before a major exam."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,58,"Indeed, research shows that moderate stress can enhance both immediate and delayed recall of educational material."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,59,"Male participants in one study who memorized a scientific text passage showed improved memory of the passage immediately after exposure to a mild stressor as well as one day following exposure to the stressor (Hupbach &amp; Fieman, 2012)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,60,Increasing one's level of stress will cause performance to change in a predictable way.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,61,"As shown in  Figure 14.4 , as stress increases, so do performance and general well-being (eustress); when stress levels reach an optimal level (the highest point of the curve), performance reaches its peak."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,62,"A person at this stress level is colloquially at the top of his game, meaning he feels fully energized, focused, and can work with minimal effort and maximum efficiency."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,70,Each of us is acquainted with stress—some are more familiar than others.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,71,"In many ways, stress feels like a load you just can't carry—a feeling you experience when, for example, you have to drive somewhere in a crippling blizzard, when you wake up late the morning of an important job interview, when you run out of money before the next pay period, and before taking an important exam for which you realize you are not fully prepared."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,72,"Figure   14.5        Nearly half of U.S. adults indicated that their stress levels have increased over the last five years (Neelakantan, 2013)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,73,"Stress is an experience that evokes a variety of responses, including those that are physiological (e.g., accelerated heart rate, headaches, or gastrointestinal problems), cognitive (e.g., difficulty concentrating or making decisions), and behavioral (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking, or taking actions directed at eliminating the cause of the stress)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,74,"Although stress can be positive at times, it can have deleterious health implications, contributing to the onset and progression of a variety of physical illnesses and diseases (Cohen &amp; Herbert, 1996)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,75,"The scientific study of how stress and other psychological factors impact health falls within the realm of  health psychology , a subfield of psychology devoted to understanding the importance of psychological influences on health, illness, and how people respond when they become ill (Taylor, 1999)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,76,"Health psychology emerged as a discipline in the 1970s, a time during which there was increasing awareness of the role behavioral and lifestyle factors play in the development of illnesses and diseases (Straub, 2007)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,77,"In addition to studying the connection between stress and illness, health psychologists investigate issues such as why people make certain lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking or eating unhealthy food despite knowing the potential adverse health implications of such behaviors)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,78,Health psychologists also design and investigate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at changing unhealthy behaviors.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,79,"Perhaps one of the more fundamental tasks of health psychologists is to identify which groups of people are especially at risk for negative health outcomes, based on psychological or behavioral factors."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,80,"For example, measuring differences in stress levels among demographic groups and how these levels change over time can help identify populations who may have an increased risk for illness or disease."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,81,"Figure 14.6  depicts the results of three national surveys in which several thousand individuals from different demographic groups completed a brief stress questionnaire; the surveys were administered in 1983, 2006, and 2009 (Cohen &amp; Janicki-Deverts, 2012)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,82,All three surveys demonstrated higher stress in women than in men.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,83,"Unemployed individuals reported high levels of stress in all three surveys, as did those with less education and income; retired persons reported the lowest stress levels."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,84,"However, from 2006 to 2009 the greatest increase in stress levels occurred among men, Whites, people aged 45–64, college graduates, and those with full-time employment."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,85,"One interpretation of these findings is that concerns surrounding the 2008–2009 economic downturn (e.g., threat of or actual job loss and substantial loss of retirement savings) may have been especially stressful to White, college-educated, employed men with limited time remaining in their working careers."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,88,"Early Contributions to the Study of Stress   As previously stated, scientific interest in stress goes back nearly a century."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,89,"One of the early pioneers in the study of stress was Walter  Cannon , an eminent American physiologist at Harvard Medical School ( Figure 14.7 )."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,90,"In the early part of the 20th century, Cannon was the first to identify the body's physiological reactions to stress."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,91,"Figure   14.7        Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon first articulated and named the fight-or-flight response, the nervous system's sympathetic response to a significant stressor."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,92,Cannon and the Fight-or-Flight Response   Imagine that you are hiking in the beautiful mountains of Colorado on a warm and sunny spring day.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,93,"At one point during your hike, a large, frightening-looking black bear appears from behind a stand of trees and sits about 50 yards from you."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,94,"The bear notices you, sits up, and begins to lumber in your direction."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,95,"In addition to thinking, ""This is definitely not good,"" a constellation of physiological reactions begins to take place inside you."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,96,"Prompted by a deluge of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from your adrenal glands, your pupils begin to dilate."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,97,"Your heart starts to pound and speeds up, you begin to breathe heavily and perspire, you get butterflies in your stomach, and your muscles become tense, preparing you to take some kind of direct action."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,98,"Cannon proposed that this reaction, which he called the  fight-or-flight response , occurs when a person experiences very strong emotions—especially those associated with a perceived threat (Cannon, 1932)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,99,"During the fight-or-flight response, the body is rapidly aroused by activation of both the sympathetic nervous system and the endocrine system ( Figure 14.8 )."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,100,This arousal helps prepare the person to either fight or flee from a perceived threat.

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,102,"According to Cannon, the fight-or-flight response is a built-in mechanism that assists in maintaining homeostasis—an internal environment in which physiological variables such as blood pressure, respiration, digestion, and temperature are stabilized at levels optimal for survival."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,103,"Thus, Cannon viewed the fight-or-flight response as adaptive because it enables us to adjust internally and externally to changes in our surroundings, which is helpful in species survival."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,105,He would eventually become one of the world's foremost experts in the study of stress ( Figure 14.9 ).
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,106,"As a young assistant in the biochemistry department at McGill University in the 1930s, Selye was engaged in research involving sex hormones in rats."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,107,"Although he was unable to find an answer for what he was initially researching, he incidentally discovered that when exposed to prolonged negative stimulation (stressors)—such as extreme cold, surgical injury, excessive muscular exercise, and shock—the rats showed signs of adrenal enlargement, thymus and lymph node shrinkage, and stomach ulceration."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,108,Selye realized that these responses were triggered by a coordinated series of physiological reactions that unfold over time during continued exposure to a stressor.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,109,"These physiological reactions were nonspecific, which means that regardless of the type of stressor, the same pattern of reactions would occur."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,110,"What Selye discovered was the  general adaptation syndrome , the body's nonspecific physiological response to stress."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,112,"In 2009, his native Hungary honored his work with this stamp, released in conjunction with the 2nd annual World Conference on Stress."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,113,"The general adaptation syndrome, shown in  Figure 14.10 , consists of three stages: (1) alarm reaction, (2) stage of resistance, and (3) stage of exhaustion (Selye, 1936; 1976)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,114,"Alarm reaction  describes the body's immediate reaction upon facing a threatening situation or emergency, and it is roughly analogous to the fight-or-flight response described by Cannon."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,115,"During an alarm reaction, you are alerted to a stressor, and your body alarms you with a cascade of physiological reactions that provide you with the energy to manage the situation."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,116,"A person who wakes up in the middle of the night to discover her house is on fire, for example, is experiencing an alarm reaction."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,118,Prolonged stress ultimately results in exhaustion.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,119,"If exposure to a stressor is prolonged, the organism will enter the  stage of resistance ."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,120,"During this stage, the initial shock of alarm reaction has worn off and the body has adapted to the stressor."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,121,"Nevertheless, the body also remains on alert and is prepared to respond as it did during the alarm reaction, although with less intensity."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,122,"For example, suppose a child who went missing is still missing 72 hours later."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,123,"Although the parents would obviously remain extremely disturbed, the magnitude of physiological reactions would likely have diminished over the 72 intervening hours due to some adaptation to this event."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,124,"If exposure to a stressor continues over a longer period of time, the  stage of exhaustion  ensues."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,125,"At this stage, the person is no longer able to adapt to the stressor: the body's ability to resist becomes depleted as physical wear takes its toll on the body's tissues and organs."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,126,"As a result, illness, disease, and other permanent damage to the body—even death—may occur."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,127,"If a missing child still remained missing after three months, the long-term stress associated with this situation may cause a parent to literally faint with exhaustion at some point or even to develop a serious and irreversible illness."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,128,"In short, Selye's general adaptation syndrome suggests that stressors tax the body via a three-phase process—an initial jolt, subsequent readjustment, and a later depletion of all physical resources—that ultimately lays the groundwork for serious health problems and even death."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,129,"It should be pointed out, however, that this model is a response-based conceptualization of stress, focusing exclusively on the body's physical responses while largely ignoring psychological factors such as appraisal and interpretation of threats."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,130,"Nevertheless, Selye's model has had an enormous impact on the field of stress because it offers a general explanation for how stress can lead to physical damage and, thus, disease."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,131,"As we shall discuss later, prolonged or repeated stress has been implicated in development of a number of disorders such as hypertension and coronary artery disease."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,133,"The physiological mechanisms of stress are extremely complex, but they generally involve the work of two systems—the  sympathetic nervous system  and the  hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,134,"When a person first perceives something as stressful (Selye's alarm reaction), the sympathetic nervous system triggers arousal via the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,135,"Release of these hormones activates the fight-or-flight responses to stress, such as accelerated heart rate and respiration."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,136,"At the same time, the HPA axis, which is primarily endocrine in nature, becomes especially active, although it works much more slowly than the sympathetic nervous system."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,137,"In response to stress, the hypothalamus (one of the limbic structures in the brain) releases corticotrophin-releasing factor, a hormone that causes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) ( Figure 14.11 )."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,138,"The ACTH then activates the adrenal glands to secrete a number of hormones into the bloodstream; an important one is cortisol, which can affect virtually every organ within the body."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,139,"Cortisol  is commonly known as a stress hormone and helps provide that boost of energy when we first encounter a stressor, preparing us to run away or fight."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,140,"However, sustained elevated levels of cortisol weaken the immune system."

a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,142,"The hypothalamus activates the pituitary gland, which in turn activates the adrenal glands, increasing their secretion of cortisol."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,143,"In short bursts, this process can have some favorable effects, such as providing extra energy, improving  immune system  functioning temporarily, and decreasing pain sensitivity."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,144,"However, extended release of cortisol—as would happen with prolonged or chronic stress—often comes at a high price."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,145,High levels of cortisol have been shown to produce a number of harmful effects.
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,146,"For example, increases in cortisol can significantly weaken our immune system (Glaser &amp; Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005), and high levels are frequently observed among depressed individuals (Geoffroy, Hertzman, Li, &amp; Power, 2013)."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,147,"In summary, a stressful event causes a variety of physiological reactions that activate the adrenal glands, which in turn release epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,148,"These hormones affect a number of bodily processes in ways that prepare the stressed person to take direct action, but also in ways that may heighten the potential for illness."
a729cfdc-f94b-4932-b2e4-0c72524d45a0@14,14,2,,149,"When stress is extreme or chronic, it can have profoundly negative consequences."

48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,35,Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating  learned helplessness : They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the noxious stimulation they were receiving.
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,36,Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression.
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,37,"Therefore, Seligman speculated that acquiring a sense of learned helplessness might be an important cause of depression in humans: Humans who experience negative life events that they believe they are unable to control may become helpless."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,38,"As a result, they give up trying to control or change the situation and some may become depressed and show lack of initiative in future situations in which they can control the outcomes (Seligman, Maier, &amp; Geer, 1968)."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,39,"Seligman and colleagues later reformulated the original learned helplessness model of depression (Abramson, Seligman, &amp; Teasdale, 1978)."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,40,"In their reformulation, they emphasized attributions (i.e., a mental explanation for why something occurred) that lead to the perception that one lacks control over negative outcomes are important in fostering a sense of learned helplessness."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,41,"For example, suppose a coworker shows up late to work; your belief as to what caused the coworker's tardiness would be an attribution (e.g., too much traffic, slept too late, or just doesn't care about being on time)."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,42,The reformulated version of Seligman's study holds that the attributions made for negative life events contribute to depression.
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,43,Consider the example of a student who performs poorly on a midterm exam.
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,44,"This model suggests that the student will make three kinds of attributions for this outcome: internal vs. external (believing the outcome was caused by his own personal inadequacies or by environmental factors), stable vs. unstable (believing the cause can be changed or is permanent), and global vs. specific (believing the outcome is a sign of inadequacy in most everything versus just this area)."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,45,"Assume that the student makes an internal (""I'm just not smart""), stable (""Nothing can be done to change the fact that I'm not smart"") and global (""This is another example of how lousy I am at everything"") attribution for the poor performance."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,46,The reformulated theory predicts that the student would perceive a lack of control over this stressful event and thus be especially prone to developing depression.
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,47,"Indeed, research has demonstrated that people who have a tendency to make internal, global, and stable attributions for bad outcomes tend to develop symptoms of depression when faced with negative life experiences (Peterson &amp; Seligman, 1984)."
48ac6ebb-54c8-4396-9a92-908995fb6ee1@11,14,5,Regulation of Stress,48,Seligman's learned helplessness model has emerged over the years as a leading theoretical explanation for the onset of major depressive disorder.

06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,1,15.1     What Are Psychological Disorders?
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,2,"Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to:    Understand the problems inherent in defining the concept of psychological disorder   Describe what is meant by harmful dysfunction   Identify the formal criteria that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must meet to be considered abnormal and, thus, symptomatic of a psychological disorder                 A  psychological disorder  is a condition characterized by abnormal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,3,"Psychopathology  is the study of psychological disorders, including their symptoms,  etiology  (i.e., their causes), and treatment."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,4,The term  psychopathology  can also refer to the manifestation of a psychological disorder.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,5,"Although consensus can be difficult, it is extremely important for mental health professionals to agree on what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are truly abnormal in the sense that they genuinely indicate the presence of psychopathology."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,6,Certain patterns of behavior and inner experience can easily be labeled as abnormal and clearly signify some kind of psychological disturbance.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,7,The person who washes his hands 40 times per day and the person who claims to hear the voices of demons exhibit behaviors and inner experiences that most would regard as abnormal: beliefs and behaviors that suggest the existence of a psychological disorder.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,8,"But, consider the nervousness a young man feels when talking to attractive women or the loneliness and longing for home a freshman experiences during her first semester of college—these feelings may not be regularly present, but they fall in the range of normal."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,9,"So, what kinds of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors represent a true psychological disorder?"
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,10,"Psychologists work to distinguish psychological disorders from inner experiences and behaviors that are merely situational, idiosyncratic, or unconventional."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,11,"Definition of a Psychological Disorder       Perhaps the simplest approach to conceptualizing psychological disorders is to label behaviors, thoughts, and inner experiences that are atypical, distressful, dysfunctional, and sometimes even dangerous, as signs of a disorder."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,12,"For example, if you ask a classmate for a date and you are rejected, you probably would feel a little dejected."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,13,Such feelings would be normal.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,14,"If you felt extremely depressed—so much so that you lost interest in activities, had difficulty eating or sleeping, felt utterly worthless, and contemplated suicide—your feelings would be  atypical , would deviate from the norm, and could signify the presence of a psychological disorder."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,15,"Just because something is atypical, however, does not necessarily mean it is disordered."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,16,"For example, only about 4% of people in the United States have red hair, so red hair is considered an atypical characteristic ( Figure 15.2 ), but it is not considered disordered, it's just unusual."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,17,"And it is less unusual in Scotland, where approximately 13% of the population has red hair (""DNA Project Aims,"" 2012)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,18,"As you will learn, some disorders, although not exactly typical, are far from atypical, and the rates in which they appear in the population are surprisingly high."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,19,"Figure   15.2        Red hair is considered unusual, but not abnormal."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,20,"a) Isla Fischer, (b) Prince Harry, and (c) Marcia Cross are three natural redheads."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,21,"If we can agree that merely being atypical is an insufficient criterion for a having a psychological disorder, is it reasonable to consider behavior or inner experiences that differ from widely expected cultural values or expectations as disordered?"
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,22,"Using this criterion, a woman who walks around a subway platform wearing a heavy winter coat in July while screaming obscenities at strangers may be considered as exhibiting symptoms of a psychological disorder."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,23,Her actions and clothes violate socially accepted rules governing appropriate dress and behavior; these characteristics are atypical.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,24,"Cultural Expectations   Violating cultural expectations is not, in and of itself, a satisfactory means of identifying the presence of a psychological disorder."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,25,"Since behavior varies from one  culture  to another, what may be expected and considered appropriate in one culture may not be viewed as such in other cultures."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,26,"For example, returning a stranger's smile is expected in the United States because a pervasive social norm dictates that we reciprocate friendly gestures."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,27,A person who refuses to acknowledge such gestures might be considered socially awkward—perhaps even disordered—for violating this expectation.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,28,"However, such expectations are not universally shared."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,29,"Cultural expectations in Japan involve showing reserve, restraint, and a concern for maintaining privacy around strangers."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,30,"Japanese people are generally unresponsive to smiles from strangers (Patterson et al., 2007)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,31,Eye contact provides another example.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,32,"In the United States and Europe, eye contact with others typically signifies honesty and attention."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,33,"However, most Latin-American, Asian, and African cultures interpret direct eye contact as rude, confrontational, and aggressive (Pazain, 2010)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,34,"Thus, someone who makes eye contact with you could be considered appropriate and respectful or brazen and offensive, depending on your culture ( Figure 15.3 )."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,35,Figure   15.3        Eye contact is one of many social gestures that vary from culture to culture.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,36,"in Western societies is a violation of cultural expectations, and a person who reports such inner experiences is readily labeled as psychologically disordered."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,37,"In other cultures, visions that, for example, pertain to future events may be regarded as normal experiences that are positively valued (Bourguignon, 1970)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,38,"Finally, it is important to recognize that cultural norms change over time: what might be considered typical in a society at one time may no longer be viewed this way later, similar to how fashion trends from one era may elicit quizzical looks decades later—imagine how a headband, legwarmers, and the big hair of the 1980s would go over on your campus today."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,39,"Dig Deeper     The Myth of Mental Illness   In the 1950s and 1960s, the concept of mental illness was widely criticized."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,40,"One of the major criticisms focused on the notion that mental illness was a ""myth that justifies psychiatric intervention in socially disapproved behavior"" (Wakefield, 1992)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,41,"Thomas Szasz (1960), a noted psychiatrist, was perhaps the biggest proponent of this view."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,42,Szasz argued that the notion of mental illness was invented by society (and the mental health establishment) to stigmatize and subjugate people whose behavior violates accepted social and legal norms.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,43,"Indeed, Szasz suggested that what appear to be symptoms of mental illness are more appropriately characterized as ""problems in living"" (Szasz, 1960)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,44,"In his 1961 book,  The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct , Szasz expressed his disdain for the concept of mental illness and for the field of psychiatry in general (Oliver, 2006)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,45,"The basis for Szasz's attack was his contention that detectable abnormalities in bodily structures and functions (e.g., infections and organ damage or dysfunction) represent the defining features of genuine illness or disease, and because symptoms of purported mental illness are not accompanied by such detectable abnormalities, so-called psychological disorders are not disorders at all."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,46,"Szasz (1961/2010) proclaimed that ""disease or illness can only affect the body; hence, there can be no mental illness"" (p. 267)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,47,"Today, we recognize the extreme level of psychological suffering experienced by people with psychological disorders: the painful thoughts and feelings they experience, the disordered behavior they demonstrate, and the levels of distress and impairment they exhibit."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,48,This makes it very difficult to deny the reality of mental illness.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,49,"However controversial Szasz's views and those of his supporters might have been, they have influenced the mental health community and society in several ways."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,50,"First, lay people, politicians, and professionals now often refer to mental illness as mental health ""problems,"" implicitly acknowledging the ""problems in living"" perspective Szasz described (Buchanan-Barker &amp; Barker, 2009)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,51,Also influential was Szasz's view of homosexuality.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,52,"Szasz was perhaps the first psychiatrist to openly challenge the idea that homosexuality represented a form of mental illness or disease (Szasz, 1965)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,53,"By challenging the idea that homosexuality represented a form a mental illness, Szasz helped pave the way for the social and civil rights that gay and lesbian people now have (Barker, 2010)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,54,"His work also inspired legal changes that protect the rights of people in psychiatric institutions and allow such individuals a greater degree of influence and responsibility over their lives (Buchanan-Barker &amp; Barker, 2009)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,55,"Harmful Dysfunction     If none of the criteria discussed so far is adequate by itself to define the presence of a psychological disorder, how can a disorder be conceptualized?"
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,56,"Many efforts have been made to identify the specific dimensions of psychological disorders, yet none is entirely satisfactory."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,57,"No universal definition of psychological disorder exists that can apply to all situations in which a disorder is thought to be present (Zachar &amp; Kendler, 2007)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,58,"However, one of the more influential conceptualizations was proposed by Wakefield (1992), who defined psychological disorder as a  harmful dysfunction ."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,59,"Wakefield argued that natural internal mechanisms—that is, psychological processes honed by evolution, such as cognition, perception, and learning—have important functions, such as enabling us to experience the world the way others do and to engage in rational thought, problem solving, and communication."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,60,"For example, learning allows us to associate a fear with a potential danger in such a way that the intensity of fear is roughly equal to the degree of actual danger."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,61,Dysfunction occurs when an internal mechanism breaks down and can no longer perform its normal function.
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,62,"But, the presence of a dysfunction by itself does not determine a disorder."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,63,"The dysfunction must be harmful in that it leads to negative consequences for the individual or for others, as judged by the standards of the individual's culture."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,64,"The harm may include significant internal anguish (e.g., high levels of anxiety or depression) or problems in day-to-day living (e.g., in one's social or work life)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,65,"To illustrate, Janet has an extreme fear of spiders."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,66,"Janet's fear might be considered a dysfunction in that it signals that the internal mechanism of learning is not working correctly (i.e., a faulty process prevents Janet from appropriately associating the magnitude of her fear with the actual threat posed by spiders)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,67,"Janet's fear of spiders has a significant negative influence on her life: she avoids all situations in which she suspects spiders to be present (e.g., the basement or a friend's home), and she quit her job last month because she saw a spider in the restroom at work and is now unemployed."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,68,"According to the harmful dysfunction model, Janet's condition would signify a disorder because (a) there is a dysfunction in an internal mechanism, and (b) the dysfunction has resulted in harmful consequences."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,69,"Similar to how the symptoms of physical illness reflect dysfunctions in biological processes, the symptoms of psychological disorders presumably reflect dysfunctions in mental processes."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,70,"The internal mechanism component of this model is especially appealing because it implies that disorders may occur through a breakdown of biological functions that govern various psychological processes, thus supporting contemporary neurobiological models of psychological disorders (Fabrega, 2007)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,71,The American Psychiatric Association (APA) Definition     Many of the features of the harmful dysfunction model are incorporated in a formal definition of psychological disorder developed by the  American Psychiatric Association  (APA).
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,72,"According to the APA (2013), a psychological disorder is a condition that is said to consist of the following:            There are significant disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors ."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,73,"A person must experience inner states (e.g., thoughts and/or feelings) and exhibit behaviors that are clearly disturbed—that is, unusual, but in a negative, self-defeating way."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,74,"Often, such disturbances are troubling to those around the individual who experiences them."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,75,"For example, an individual who is uncontrollably preoccupied by thoughts of germs spends hours each day bathing, has inner experiences, and displays behaviors that most would consider atypical and negative (disturbed) and that would likely be troubling to family members."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,76,"The disturbances reflect some kind of biological, psychological, or developmental dysfunction ."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,77,"Disturbed patterns of inner experiences and behaviors should reflect some flaw (dysfunction) in the internal biological, psychological, and developmental mechanisms that lead to normal, healthy psychological functioning."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,78,"For example, the hallucinations observed in schizophrenia could be a sign of brain abnormalities."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,79,The disturbances lead to significant distress or disability in one's life .
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,80,"A person's inner experiences and behaviors are considered to reflect a psychological disorder if they cause the person considerable distress, or greatly impair his ability to function as a normal individual (often referred to as functional impairment, or occupational and social impairment)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,81,"As an illustration, a person's fear of social situations might be so distressing that it causes the person to avoid all social situations (e.g., preventing that person from being able to attend class or apply for a job)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,82,The disturbances do not reflect expected or culturally approved responses to certain events .
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,83,"Disturbances in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors must be socially unacceptable responses to certain events that often happen in life."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,84,"For example, it is perfectly natural (and expected) that a person would experience great sadness and might wish to be left alone following the death of a close family member."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,85,"Because such reactions are in some ways culturally expected, the individual would not be assumed to signify a mental disorder."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,86,"Some believe that there is no essential criterion or set of criteria that can definitively distinguish all cases of disorder from nondisorder (Lilienfeld &amp; Marino, 1999)."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,87,"In truth, no single approach to defining a psychological disorder is adequate by itself, nor is there universal agreement on where the boundary is between disordered and not disordered."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,88,"From time to time we all experience anxiety, unwanted thoughts, and moments of sadness; our behavior at other times may not make much sense to ourselves or to others."
06cd86b6-1e28-4861-bfa5-16badaeae8c4@11,15,2,,89,"These inner experiences and behaviors can vary in their intensity, but are only considered disordered when they are highly disturbing to us and/or others, suggest a dysfunction in normal mental functioning, and are associated with significant distress or disability in social or occupational activities."

597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,28,Rachman (1977) proposed that phobias can be acquired through three major learning pathways.
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,29,The first pathway is through  classical conditioning .
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,30,"As you may recall, classical conditioning is a form of learning in which a previously neutral stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that reflexively elicits an unconditioned response (UCR), eliciting the same response through its association with the unconditioned stimulus."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,31,The response is called a conditioned response (CR).
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,32,"For example, a child who has been bitten by a dog may come to fear dogs because of her past association with pain."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,33,"In this case, the dog bite is the UCS and the fear it elicits is the UCR."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,34,"Because a dog was associated with the bite, any dog may come to serve as a conditioned stimulus, thereby eliciting fear; the fear the child experiences around dogs, then, becomes a CR."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,35,"The second pathway of phobia acquisition is through vicarious learning, such as  modeling ."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,36,"For example, a child who observes his cousin react fearfully to spiders may later express the same fears, even though spiders have never presented any danger to him."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,37,"This phenomenon has been observed in both humans and nonhuman primates (Olsson &amp; Phelps, 2007)."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,38,"A study of laboratory-reared monkeys readily acquired a fear of snakes after observing wild-reared monkeys react fearfully to snakes (Mineka &amp; Cook, 1993)."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,39,The third pathway is through verbal transmission or information.
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,40,"For example, a child whose parents, siblings, friends, and classmates constantly tell her how disgusting and dangerous snakes are may come to acquire a fear of snakes."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,41,"Interestingly, people are more likely to develop phobias of things that do not represent much actual danger to themselves, such as animals and heights, and are less likely to develop phobias toward things that present legitimate danger in contemporary society, such as motorcycles and weapons (Öhman &amp; Mineka, 2001)."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,42,Why might this be so?
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,43,"One theory suggests that the human brain is evolutionarily predisposed to more readily associate certain objects or situations with fear (Seligman, 1971)."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,44,"This theory argues that throughout our evolutionary history, our ancestors associated certain stimuli (e.g., snakes, spiders, heights, and thunder) with potential danger."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,45,"As time progressed, the mind has become adapted to more readily develop fears of these things than of others."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,46,"Experimental evidence has consistently demonstrated that conditioned fears develop more readily to fear-relevant stimuli (images of snakes and spiders) than to fear-irrelevant stimuli (images of flowers and berries) (Öhman &amp; Mineka, 2001)."
597edb02-3985-4733-9361-fe046d01ac4f@12,15,5,Anxiety Disorders,47,Such prepared learning has also been shown to occur in monkeys.

a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,33,"Studies have implicated about two dozen potential genes that may be involved in OCD; these genes regulate the function of three neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate (Pauls, 2010)."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,34,Many of these studies included small sample sizes and have yet to be replicated.
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,35,"Thus, additional research needs to be done in this area."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,36,"A brain region that is believed to play a critical role in OCD is the  orbitofrontal cortex  (Kopell &amp; Greenberg, 2008), an area of the frontal lobe involved in learning and decision-making (Rushworth, Noonan, Boorman, Walton, &amp; Behrens, 2011) ( Figure 15.13 )."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,37,"In people with OCD, the orbitofrontal cortex becomes especially hyperactive when they are provoked with tasks in which, for example, they are asked to look at a photo of a toilet or of pictures hanging crookedly on a wall (Simon, Kaufmann, Müsch, Kischkel, &amp; Kathmann, 2010)."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,38,"The orbitofrontal cortex is part of a series of brain regions that, collectively, is called the OCD circuit; this circuit consists of several interconnected regions that influence the perceived emotional value of stimuli and the selection of both behavioral and cognitive responses (Graybiel &amp; Rauch, 2000)."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,39,"As with the orbitofrontal cortex, other regions of the OCD circuit show heightened activity during symptom provocation (Rotge et al., 2008), which suggests that abnormalities in these regions may produce the symptoms of OCD (Saxena, Bota, &amp; Brody, 2001)."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,40,"Consistent with this explanation, people with OCD show a substantially higher degree of connectivity of the orbitofrontal cortex and other regions of the OCD circuit than do those without OCD (Beucke et al., 2013)."

a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,43,"However, one important limitation of these findings is the inability to explain differences in obsessions and compulsions."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,44,"Another limitation is that the correlational relationship between neurological abnormalities and OCD symptoms cannot imply causation (Abramowitz &amp; Siqueland, 2013)."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,45,"Connect the Concepts     Conditioning and OCD   The symptoms of OCD have been theorized to be learned responses, acquired and sustained as the result of a combination of two forms of learning:  classical conditioning  and  operant conditioning  (Mowrer, 1960; Steinmetz, Tracy, &amp; Green, 2001)."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,46,"Specifically, the acquisition of OCD may occur first as the result of classical conditioning, whereby a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus that provokes anxiety or distress."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,47,"When an individual has acquired this association, subsequent encounters with the neutral stimulus trigger anxiety, including obsessive thoughts; the anxiety and obsessive thoughts (which are now a conditioned response) may persist until she identifies some strategy to relieve it."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,48,"Relief may take the form of a ritualistic behavior or mental activity that, when enacted repeatedly, reduces the anxiety."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,49,Such efforts to relieve anxiety constitute an example of negative reinforcement (a form of operant conditioning).
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,50,Recall from the chapter on learning that negative reinforcement involves the strengthening of behavior through its ability to remove something unpleasant or aversive.
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,51,"Hence, compulsive acts observed in OCD may be sustained because they are negatively reinforcing, in the sense that they reduce anxiety triggered by a conditioned stimulus."
a45eef58-d072-4c7f-a84a-f5fb08299b81@11,15,6,,52,"Suppose an individual with OCD experiences obsessive thoughts about germs, contamination, and disease whenever she encounters a doorknob."

7b8c4a5f-f554-482d-91dc-3884cbd84781@12,15,8,Mood Disorders,93,"Interestingly, heightened amygdala activation to negative emotional stimuli among depressed persons occurs even when stimuli are presented outside of conscious awareness (Victor, Furey, Fromm, Öhman, &amp; Drevets, 2010), and it persists even after the negative emotional stimuli are no longer present (Siegle, Thompson, Carter, Steinhauer, &amp; Thase, 2007)."

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,43,"The risk of developing schizophrenia is nearly 6 times greater if one has a parent with schizophrenia than if one does not (Goldstein, Buka, Seidman, &amp; Tsuang, 2010)."
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,44,"Additionally, one's risk of developing schizophrenia increases as genetic relatedness to family members diagnosed with schizophrenia increases (Gottesman, 2001)."

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,46,"This is because family members who are closely related (such as siblings) are more likely to share similar environments than are family members who are less closely related (such as cousins); further, identical twins may be more likely to be treated similarly by others than might fraternal twins."
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,47,"Thus, family and twin studies cannot completely rule out the possible effects of shared environments and experiences."

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,56,The researchers managed to determine whether the adoptees' families were either healthy or disturbed.
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,57,"For example, the adoptees were considered to be raised in a disturbed family environment if the family exhibited a lot of criticism, conflict, and a lack of problem-solving skills."
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,58,"The findings revealed that adoptees whose mothers had schizophrenia (high genetic risk)  and  who had been raised in a disturbed family environment were much more likely to develop schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder (36.8%) than were adoptees whose biological mothers had schizophrenia but who had been raised in a healthy environment (5.8%), or than adoptees with a low genetic risk who were raised in either a disturbed (5.3%) or healthy (4.8%) environment."
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,59,"Because the adoptees who were at high genetic risk were likely to develop schizophrenia  only  if they were raised in a disturbed home environment, this study supports a diathesis-stress interpretation of schizophrenia—both genetic vulnerability and environmental stress are necessary for schizophrenia to develop, genes alone do not show the complete picture."

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,65,More recent work in this area suggests that abnormalities in dopamine vary by brain region and thus contribute to symptoms in unique ways.
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,66,"In general, this research has suggested that an overabundance of dopamine in the limbic system may be responsible for some symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, whereas low levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex might be responsible primarily for the negative symptoms (avolition, alogia, asociality, and anhedonia) (Davis, Kahn, Ko, &amp; Davidson, 1991)."

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,74,A number of environmental factors that could impact normal brain development might be at fault.

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,77,Research has also suggested that a mother's emotional stress during pregnancy may increase the risk of schizophrenia in offspring.

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,81,"However, a number of longitudinal studies have suggested that marijuana use is, in fact, a risk factor for schizophrenia."
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,82,"A classic investigation of over 45,000 Swedish conscripts who were followed up after 15 years found that those individuals who had reported using marijuana at least once by the time of conscription were more than 2 times as likely to develop schizophrenia during the ensuing 15 years than were those who reported never using marijuana; those who had indicated using marijuana 50 or more times were 6 times as likely to develop schizophrenia (Andréasson, Allbeck, Engström, &amp; Rydberg, 1987)."

8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,84,"Other work has found that marijuana use is associated with an onset of psychotic disorders at an earlier age (Large, Sharma, Compton, Slade, &amp; Nielssen, 2011)."
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,85,"Overall, the available evidence seems to indicate that marijuana use plays a causal role in the development of schizophrenia, although it is important to point out that marijuana use is not an essential or sufficient risk factor as not all people with schizophrenia have used marijuana and the majority of marijuana users do not develop schizophrenia (Casadio, Fernandes, Murray, &amp; Di Forti, 2011)."
8060ffc0-d4de-49d4-8586-1d003430997f@11,15,9,Schizophrenia,86,"One plausible interpretation of the data is that early marijuana use may disrupt normal brain development during important early maturation periods in adolescence (Trezza, Cuomo, &amp; Vanderschuren, 2008)."

381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,15,"Today,  borderline personality disorder  has a completely different meaning."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,16,"Borderline personality disorder is characterized chiefly by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and mood, as well as marked impulsivity (APA, 2013)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,17,People with borderline personality disorder cannot tolerate the thought of being alone and will make frantic efforts (including making suicidal gestures and engaging in self-mutilation) to avoid abandonment or separation (whether real or imagined).
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,18,"Their relationships are intense and unstable; for example, a lover may be idealized early in a relationship, but then later vilified at the slightest sign she appears to no longer show interest."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,19,"These individuals have an unstable view of self and, thus, might suddenly display a shift in personal attitudes, interests, career plans, and choice of friends."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,20,"For example, a law school student may, despite having invested tens of thousands of dollars toward earning a law degree and despite having performed well in the program, consider dropping out and pursuing a career in another field."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,21,"People with borderline personality disorder may be highly impulsive and may engage in reckless and self-destructive behaviors such as excessive gambling, spending money irresponsibly, substance abuse, engaging in unsafe sex, and reckless driving."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,22,"They sometimes show intense and inappropriate anger that they have difficulty controlling, and they can be moody, sarcastic, bitter, and verbally abusive."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,23,"The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the U.S. population is estimated to be around 1.4% (Lezenweger et al., 2007), but the rates are higher among those who use mental health services; approximately 10% of mental health outpatients and 20% of psychiatric inpatients meet the criteria for diagnosis (APA, 2013)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,24,"Additionally, borderline personality disorder is comorbid with anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders (Lezenweger et al., 2007)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,25,Biological Basis for Borderline Personality Disorder         Genetic factors appear to be important in the development of borderline personality disorder.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,26,"For example, core personality traits that characterize this disorder, such as impulsivity and emotional instability, show a high degree of heritability (Livesley, 2008)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,27,"Also, the rates of borderline personality disorder among relatives of people with this disorder have been found to be as high as 24.9% (White, Gunderson, Zanarani, &amp; Hudson, 2003)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,28,"Individuals with borderline personality disorder report experiencing childhood physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse at rates far greater than those observed in the general population (Afifi et al., 2010), indicating that environmental factors are also crucial."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,29,These findings would suggest that borderline personality disorder may be determined by an interaction between genetic factors and adverse environmental experiences.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,30,"Consistent with this hypothesis, one study found that the highest rates of borderline personality disorder were among individuals with a borderline temperament (characterized by high novelty seeking and high harm-avoidance) and those who experienced childhood abuse and/or neglect (Joyce et al., 2003)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,31,"Antisocial Personality Disorder       Most human beings live in accordance with a moral compass, a sense of right and wrong."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,32,Most individuals learn at a very young age that there are certain things that should not be done.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,33,We learn that we should not lie or cheat.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,34,"We are taught that it is wrong to take things that do not belong to us, and that it is wrong to exploit others for personal gain."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,35,"We also learn the importance of living up to our responsibilities, of doing what we say we will do."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,36,"People with antisocial personality disorder, however, do not seem to have a moral compass."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,37,These individuals act as though they neither have a sense of nor care about right or wrong.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,38,"Not surprisingly, these people represent a serious problem for others and for society in general."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,39,"According to the DSM-5, the individual with  antisocial personality disorder  (sometimes referred to as psychopathy) shows no regard at all for other people's rights or feelings."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,40,"This lack of regard is exhibited a number of ways and can include repeatedly performing illegal acts, lying to or conning others, impulsivity and recklessness, irritability and aggressiveness toward others, and failure to act in a responsible way (e.g., leaving debts unpaid) (APA, 2013)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,41,"The worst part about antisocial personality disorder, however, is that people with this disorder have no remorse over one's misdeeds; these people will hurt, manipulate, exploit, and abuse others and not feel any guilt."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,42,"Signs of this disorder can emerge early in life; however, a person must be at least 18 years old to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,43,People with antisocial personality disorder seem to view the world as self-serving and unkind.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,44,They seem to think that they should use whatever means necessary to get by in life.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,45,"They tend to view others not as living, thinking, feeling beings, but rather as pawns to be used or abused for a specific purpose."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,46,They often have an over-inflated sense of themselves and can appear extremely arrogant.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,47,"They frequently display superficial charm; for example, without really meaning it they might say exactly what they think another person wants to hear."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,48,They lack empathy: they are incapable of understanding the emotional point-of-view of others.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,49,"People with this disorder may become involved in illegal enterprises, show cruelty toward others, leave their jobs with no plans to obtain another job, have multiple sexual partners, repeatedly get into fights with others, and show reckless disregard for themselves and others (e.g., repeated arrests for driving while intoxicated) (APA, 2013)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,50,"A useful way to conceptualize antisocial personality disorder is boiling the diagnosis down to three major concepts: disinhibition, boldness, and meanness (Patrick, Fowles, &amp; Krueger, 2009)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,51,"Disinhibition is a propensity toward impulse control problems, lack of planning and forethought, insistence on immediate gratification, and inability to restrain behavior."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,52,"Boldness describes a tendency to remain calm in threatening situations, high self-assurance, a sense of dominance, and a tendency toward thrill-seeking."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,53,"Meanness is defined as ""aggressive resource seeking without regard for others,"" and is signaled by a lack of empathy, disdain for and lack of close relationships with others, and a tendency to accomplish goals through cruelty (Patrick et al., 2009, p. 913)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,54,"Risk Factors for Antisocial Personality Disorder         Antisocial personality disorder is observed in about 3.6% of the population; the disorder is much more common among males, with a 3 to 1 ratio of men to women, and it is more likely to occur in men who are younger, widowed, separated, divorced, of lower socioeconomic status, who live in urban areas, and who live in the western United States (Compton, Conway, Stinson, Colliver, &amp; Grant, 2005)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,55,"Compared to men with antisocial personality disorder, women with the disorder are more likely to have experienced emotional neglect and sexual abuse during childhood, and they are more likely to have had parents who abused substances and who engaged in antisocial behaviors themselves (Alegria et al., 2013)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,56,"Table 15.3  shows some of the differences in the specific types of antisocial behaviors that men and women with antisocial personality disorder exhibit (Alegria et al., 2013)."

381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,58,"Personality and temperament dimensions that are related to this disorder, including fearlessness, impulsive antisociality, and callousness, have a substantial genetic influence (Livesley &amp; Jang, 2008)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,59,"Adoption studies clearly demonstrate that the development of antisocial behavior is determined by the interaction of genetic factors and adverse environmental circumstances (Rhee &amp; Waldman, 2002)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,60,"For example, one investigation found that adoptees of biological parents with antisocial personality disorder were more likely to exhibit adolescent and adult antisocial behaviors if they were raised in adverse adoptive family environments (e.g., adoptive parents had marital problems, were divorced, used drugs, and had legal problems) than if they were raised in a more normal adoptive environment (Cadoret, Yates, Ed, Woodworth, &amp; Stewart, 1995)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,61,"Researchers who are interested in the importance of environment in the development of antisocial personality disorder have directed their attention to such factors as the community, the structure and functioning of the family, and peer groups."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,62,Each of these factors influences the likelihood of antisocial behavior.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,63,"One longitudinal investigation of more than 800 Seattle-area youth measured risk factors for violence at 10, 14, 16, and 18 years of age (Herrenkohl et al., 2000)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,64,"The risk factors examined included those involving the family, peers, and community."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,65,A portion of the findings from this study are provided in  Figure 15.19 .
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,66,Figure   15.19        Longitudinal studies have helped to identify risk factors for predicting violent behavior.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,67,Those with antisocial tendencies do not seem to experience emotions the way most other people do.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,68,"These individuals fail to show fear in response to environment cues that signal punishment, pain, or noxious stimulation."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,69,"For instance, they show less skin conductance (sweatiness on hands) in anticipation of electric shock than do people without antisocial tendencies (Hare, 1965)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,70,Skin conductance is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system and is used to assess autonomic nervous system functioning.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,71,"When the sympathetic nervous system is active, people become aroused and anxious, and sweat gland activity increases."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,72,"Thus, increased sweat gland activity, as assessed through skin conductance, is taken as a sign of arousal or anxiety."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,73,"For those with antisocial personality disorder, a lack of skin conductance may indicate the presence of characteristics such as emotional deficits and impulsivity that underlie the propensity for antisocial behavior and negative social relationships (Fung et al., 2005)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,74,"While emotional deficits may contribute to antisocial personality disorder, so too might an inability to relate to others' pain."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,75,"In a recent study, 80 prisoners were shown photos of people being intentionally hurt by others (e.g., someone crushing a person's hand in an automobile door) while undergoing brain imaging (Decety, Skelly, &amp; Kiehl, 2013)."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,76,Prisoners who scored high on a test of antisocial tendencies showed significantly less activation in brain regions involved in the experience of empathy and feeling concerned for others than did prisoners with low scores on the antisocial test.
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,77,"Notably, the prisoners who scored high on the antisocial test showed greater activation in a brain area involved self-awareness, cognitive function, and interpersonal experience."
381b56ba-fd11-4deb-88cb-d8c46a7b29a5@11,15,11,Personality Disorders,78,The investigators suggested that the heightened activation in this region when watching social interactions involving one person harming another may reflect a propensity or desire for this kind of behavior.

b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,11,The symptoms of this disorder were first described by Hans Hoffman in the 1920s.
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,12,"While taking care of his son while his wife was in the hospital giving birth to a second child, Hoffman noticed that the boy had trouble concentrating on his homework, had a short attention span, and had to repeatedly go over easy homework to learn the material (Jellinek &amp; Herzog, 1999)."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,13,"Later, it was discovered that many hyperactive children—those who are fidgety, restless, socially disruptive, and have trouble with impulse control—also display short attention spans, problems with concentration, and distractibility."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,14,"By the 1970s, it had become clear that many children who display attention problems often also exhibit signs of hyperactivity."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,15,"In recognition of such findings, the DSM-III (published in 1980) included a new disorder: attention deficit disorder with and without hyperactivity, now known as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)."

b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,105,Bruno Bettelheim (an Austrian-born American child psychologist who was heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud's ideas) suggested that a mother's ambivalent attitudes and her frozen and rigid emotions toward her child were the main causal factors in childhood autism.
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,106,"In what must certainly stand as one of the more controversial assertions in psychology over the last 50 years, he wrote, ""I state my belief that the precipitating factor in infantile autism is the parent's wish that his child should not exist"" (Bettelheim, 1967, p. 125)."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,107,"As you might imagine, Bettelheim did not endear himself to a lot of people with this position; incidentally, no scientific evidence exists supporting his claims."

b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,110,"Many different genes and gene mutations have been implicated in autism (Meek et al., 2013)."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,111,"Among the genes involved are those important in the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate communication between different areas of the brain (Gauthier et al., 2011)."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,112,"A number of environmental factors are also thought to be associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part, because they contribute to new mutations."

b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,115,"These findings were very controversial and drew a great deal of attention, sparking an international forum on whether children should be vaccinated."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,116,"In a shocking turn of events, some years later the article was retracted by the journal that had published it after accusations of fraud on the part of the lead researcher."

b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,119,Some parents of children with autism mounted a campaign against scientists who refuted the vaccine-autism link.
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,120,"Even politicians and several well-known celebrities weighed in; for example, actress Jenny McCarthy (who believed that a vaccination caused her son's autism) co-authored a book on the matter."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,121,"However, there is no scientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations (Hughes, 2007)."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,122,"Indeed, a recent study compared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder with that of 752 control children across three time periods during their first two years of life (birth to 3 months, birth to 7 months, and birth to 2 years) (DeStefano, Price, &amp; Weintraub, 2013)."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,123,"At the time of the study, the children were between 6 and 13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,124,"Because vaccines contain immunogens (substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see how many immunogens children received to determine if those children who received more immunogens were at greater risk for developing autism spectrum disorder."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,125,"The results of this study, a portion of which are shown in  Figure 15.20 , clearly demonstrate that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two years of life were not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,126,There is not a relationship between vaccinations and autism spectrum disorders.

b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,128,Why does concern over vaccines and autism spectrum disorder persist?
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,129,"Since the proliferation of the Internet in the 1990s, parents have been constantly bombarded with online information that can become magnified and take on a life of its own."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,130,"The enormous volume of electronic information pertaining to autism spectrum disorder, combined with how difficult it can be to grasp complex scientific concepts, can make separating good research from bad challenging (Downs, 2008)."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,131,"Notably, the study that fueled the controversy reported that 8 out of 12 children—according to their parents—developed symptoms consistent with autism spectrum disorder shortly after receiving a vaccination."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,132,"To conclude that vaccines cause autism spectrum disorder on this basis, as many did, is clearly incorrect for a number of reasons, not the least of which is because correlation does not imply causation, as you've learned."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,133,"Additionally, as was the case with diet and ADHD in the 1970s, the notion that autism spectrum disorder is caused by vaccinations is appealing to some because it provides a simple explanation for this condition."
b80499e9-d8c6-4219-84c2-d6f18b5f0d27@11,15,12,Disorders in Childhood,134,"Like all disorders, however, there are no simple explanations for autism spectrum disorder."

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,36,"It was the dominant therapeutic technique in the early 20th century, but it has since waned significantly in popularity."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,37,"Freud believed most of our psychological problems are the result of repressed impulses and trauma experienced in childhood, and he believed psychoanalysis would help uncover long-buried feelings."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,38,"In a psychoanalyst's office, you might see a patient lying on a couch speaking of dreams or childhood memories, and the therapist using various Freudian methods such as free association and dream analysis ( Figure 16.9 )."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,39,"In  free association , the patient relaxes and then says whatever comes to mind at the moment."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,40,"However, Freud felt that the ego would at times try to block, or repress, unacceptable urges or painful conflicts during free association."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,41,"Consequently, a patient would demonstrate resistance to recalling these thoughts or situations."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,42,"In  dream analysis , a therapist interprets the underlying meaning of dreams."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,43,Psychoanalysis is a therapy approach that typically takes years.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,44,"Over the course of time, the patient reveals a great deal about himself to the therapist."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,45,"Freud suggested that during this patient-therapist relationship, the patient comes to develop strong feelings for the therapist—maybe positive feelings, maybe negative feelings."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,46,Freud called this  transference : the patient transfers all the positive or negative emotions associated with the patient's other relationships to the psychoanalyst.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,47,"For example, Crystal is seeing a psychoanalyst."

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,51,Patients were instructed to lie comfortably on the couch and to face away from Freud in order to feel less inhibited and to help them focus.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,52,"Today, a psychotherapy patient is not likely to lie on a couch; instead he is more likely to sit facing the therapist (Prochaska &amp; Norcross, 2010)."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,53,"Today, Freud's psychoanalytical perspective has been expanded upon by the developments of subsequent theories and methodologies: the  psychodynamic  perspective."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,54,"This approach to therapy remains centered on the role of people's internal drives and forces, but treatment is less intensive than Freud's original model."

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,57,"This technique uses a therapeutic process of play to ""help clients prevent or resolve psychosocial difficulties and achieve optimal growth"" (O'Connor, 2000, p. 7)."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,58,"The idea is that children play out their hopes, fantasies, and traumas while using dolls, stuffed animals, and sandbox figurines ( Figure 16.10 )."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,59,Play therapy can also be used to help a therapist make a diagnosis.

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,61,Play therapy can be nondirective or directive.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,62,"In nondirective play therapy, children are encouraged to work through their problems by playing freely while the therapist observes (LeBlanc &amp; Ritchie, 2001)."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,63,"In directive play therapy, the therapist provides more structure and guidance in the play session by suggesting topics, asking questions, and even playing with the child (Harter, 1977)."

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,67,"In  behavior therapy , a therapist employs principles of learning to help clients change undesirable behaviors—rather than digging deeply into one's unconscious."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,68,"Therapists with this orientation believe that dysfunctional behaviors, like phobias and bedwetting, can be changed by teaching clients new, more constructive behaviors."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,69,Behavior therapy employs both classical and operant conditioning techniques to change behavior.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,70,One type of behavior therapy utilizes classical conditioning techniques.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,71,Therapists using these techniques believe that dysfunctional behaviors are conditioned responses.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,72,"Applying the conditioning principles developed by Ivan Pavlov, these therapists seek to recondition their clients and thus change their behavior."

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,76,"When moisture touches the pad, it sets off the alarm, waking up Emmie."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,77,"When this process is repeated enough times, Emmie develops an association between urinary relaxation and waking up, and this stops the bedwetting."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,78,Emmie has now gone three weeks without wetting her bed and is looking forward to her first sleepover this weekend.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,79,One commonly used classical conditioning therapeutic technique is  counterconditioning : a client learns a new response to a stimulus that has previously elicited an undesirable behavior.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,80,Two counterconditioning techniques are aversive conditioning and exposure therapy.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,81,Aversive conditioning  uses an unpleasant stimulus to stop an undesirable behavior.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,82,"Therapists apply this technique to eliminate addictive behaviors, such as  smoking, nail biting, and drinking."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,83,"In aversion therapy, clients will typically engage in a specific behavior (such as nail biting) and at the same time are exposed to something unpleasant, such as a mild electric shock or a bad taste."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,84,"After repeated associations between the unpleasant stimulus and the behavior, the client can learn to stop the unwanted behavior."

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,86,One common way this occurs is through a chemically based substance known as Antabuse.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,87,"When a person takes Antabuse and then consumes alcohol, uncomfortable side effects result including nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, heart palpitations, severe headache, and shortness of breath."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,88,"Antabuse is repeatedly paired with alcohol until the client associates alcohol with unpleasant feelings, which decreases the client's desire to consume alcohol."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,89,Antabuse creates a conditioned aversion to alcohol because it replaces the original pleasure response with an unpleasant one.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,90,"In  exposure therapy , a therapist seeks to treat clients' fears or anxiety by presenting them with the object or situation that causes their problem, with the idea that they will eventually get used to it."

37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,94,"Her goal was to replace Peter's fear of rabbits with a conditioned response of relaxation, which is a response that is incompatible with fear ( Figure 16.11 )."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,95,How did she do it?
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,96,Jones began by placing a caged rabbit on the other side of a room with Peter while he ate his afternoon snack.
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,97,"Over the course of several days, Jones moved the rabbit closer and closer to where Peter was seated with his snack."
37c1e376-2e61-4df3-8e03-2a924a270b33@15,16,3,Types of Treatment,98,"After two months of being exposed to the rabbit while relaxing with his snack, Peter was able to hold the rabbit and pet it while eating (Jones, 1924)."

e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,14,Specific factors make substance-related treatment much more effective.
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,15,One factor is duration of treatment.
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,16,"Generally, a person with addict needs to be in treatment for at least three months to achieve a positive outcome (Simpson, 1981; Simpson, Joe, &amp; Bracy, 1982; NIDA, 2012)."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,17,"This is due to the psychological, physiological, behavioral, and social aspects of abuse (Simpson, 1981; Simpson et al., 1982; NIDA, 2012)."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,18,"While in treatment, a person with addiction might receive behavior therapy, which can help motivate the person with addiction to participate in the treatment program and teach strategies for dealing with cravings and how to prevent relapse."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,19,"Also, treatment needs to be holistic and address multiple needs, not just the drug addiction."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,20,"This means that treatment will address factors such as communication, stress management, relationship issues, parenting, vocational concerns, and legal concerns (McGovern &amp; Carroll, 2003; NIDA, 2012)."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,21,"While individual therapy is used in the treatment of substance-related disorders, group therapy is the most widespread treatment modality (Weiss, Jaffee, de Menil, &amp; Cogley, 2004)."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,22,The rationale behind using group therapy for addiction treatment is that people with addiction are much more likely to maintain sobriety in a group format.
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,23,"It has been suggested that this is due to the rewarding and therapeutic benefits of the group, such as support, affiliation, identification, and even confrontation (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2005)."

e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,27,"Also, mothers who participated in treatment displayed better mental health and greater warmth toward their children (Bertrand et al., 2013)."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,28,"However, neither individual nor group therapy has been found to be more effective (Weiss et al., 2004)."

e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,39,Drug abuse can cause symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders and the reverse is also true—people with debilitating symptoms of a psychiatric disorder may self-medicate and abuse substances.
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,40,"In cases of  comorbidity , the best treatment is thought to address both (or multiple) disorders simultaneously (NIDA, 2012)."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,41,"Behavior therapies are used to treat comorbid conditions, and in many cases, psychotropic medications are used along with psychotherapy."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,42,"For example, evidence suggests that bupropion (trade names: Wellbutrin and Zyban), approved for treating depression and nicotine dependence, might also help reduce craving and use of the drug methamphetamine (NIDA, 2011)."
e10198bc-f204-4784-a38b-4f639223cc7f@12,16,5,,43,"However, more research is needed to better understand how these medications work—particularly when combined in patients with comorbidities."

4f53d6a9-4cb7-4f9c-b0c4-d7cd9d1b5c39@11,16,6,The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization,19,Why is this so?
4f53d6a9-4cb7-4f9c-b0c4-d7cd9d1b5c39@11,16,6,The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization,20,Perhaps the reason has to do with access and availability of mental health services.

4f53d6a9-4cb7-4f9c-b0c4-d7cd9d1b5c39@11,16,6,The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization,22,"However, researchers have found that even when income levels and insurance variables are taken into account, ethnic minorities are far less likely to seek out and utilize mental health services."
4f53d6a9-4cb7-4f9c-b0c4-d7cd9d1b5c39@11,16,6,The Sociocultural Model and Therapy Utilization,23,"And when access to mental health services is comparable across ethnic and racial groups, differences in service utilization remain (Richman et al., 2007)."
