2,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"Problem-focused coping strategies are similar to strategies used in everyday problem-solving: they typically involve identifying the problem, considering possible solutions, weighing the costs and benefits of these solutions, and then selecting an alternative (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,6

3,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"These efforts may include avoiding, minimizing, or distancing oneself from the problem, or positive comparisons with others (“I’m not as bad off as she is”), or seeking something positive in a negative event (“Now that I’ve been fired, I can sleep in for a few days”).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,12
3,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"In some cases, emotion-focused coping strategies involve reappraisal, whereby the stressor is construed differently (and somewhat self-deceptively) without changing its objective level of threat (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,13

4,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"While many stressors elicit both kinds of coping strategies, problem-focused coping is more likely to occur when encountering stressors we perceive as controllable, while emotion-focused coping is more likely to predominate when faced with stressors that we believe we are powerless to change (Folkman &  Lazarus, 1980).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,17

7,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"In one of the better illustrations of this concept, psychologist Martin Seligman conducted a series of classic experiments in the 1960s (Seligman & Maier, 1967) in which dogs were placed in a chamber where they received electric shocks from which they could not escape.",14,4,regulation-of-stress,34
7,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"Later, when these dogs were given the opportunity to escape the shocks by jumping across a partition, most failed to even try; they seemed to just give up and passively accept any shocks the experimenters chose to administer.",14,4,regulation-of-stress,35
7,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"In comparison, dogs who were previously allowed to escape the shocks tended to jump the partition and escape the pain (Figure 14.22).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,36
8,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,Seligman believed that the dogs who failed to try to escape the later shocks were demonstrating learned helplessness: They had acquired a belief that they were powerless to do anything about the stimulation they were receiving.,14,4,regulation-of-stress,37
8,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,Seligman also believed that the passivity and lack of initiative these dogs demonstrated was similar to that observed in human depression.,14,4,regulation-of-stress,38
8,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"Therefore, Seligman speculated that learned helplessness might be an important cause of depression in humans: Humans who experience negative life events that they believe they are unable to control may become helpless.",14,4,regulation-of-stress,39
8,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"As a result, they give up trying to change the situation and some may become depressed and show lack of initiative in future situations in which they can control the outcomes (Seligman, Maier, & Geer, 1968).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,40
8,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"Sadly, learned helplessness was later used to justify the torture of prisoners by U.S. military personnel following the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center.",14,4,regulation-of-stress,41

9,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"In their reformulation, they emphasized attributions (i.e., a mental explanation for why something occurred) that fostered a sense of learned helplessness.",14,4,regulation-of-stress,47
9,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"For example, suppose a coworker shows up late to work; your belief as to what caused the coworker’s tardiness would be an attribution (e.g., too much traffic, slept too late, or just doesn’t care about being on time).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,48
10,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,The reformulated version of Seligman’s study holds that the attributions made for negative life events contribute to depression.,14,4,regulation-of-stress,49
10,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,Consider the example of a student who performs poorly on a midterm exam.,14,4,regulation-of-stress,50
10,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"This model suggests that the student will make three kinds of attributions for this outcome: internal vs. external (believing the outcome was caused by his own personal inadequacies or by environmental factors), stable vs. unstable (believing the cause can be changed or is permanent), and global vs. specific (believing the outcome is a sign of inadequacy in most everything versus just this area).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,51
10,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"Assume that the student makes an internal (“I’m just not smart”), stable (“Nothing can be done to change the fact that I’m not smart”) and global (“This is another example of how lousy I am at everything”) attribution for the poor performance.",14,4,regulation-of-stress,52
10,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,The reformulated theory predicts that the student would perceive a lack of control over this stressful event and thus be especially prone to developing depression.,14,4,regulation-of-stress,53
10,https://openstax.org/books/psychology-2e/pages/14-4-regulation-of-stress,"Indeed, research has demonstrated that people who have a tendency to make internal, global, and stable attributions for bad outcomes tend to develop symptoms of depression when faced with negative life experiences (Peterson & Seligman, 1984).",14,4,regulation-of-stress,54
