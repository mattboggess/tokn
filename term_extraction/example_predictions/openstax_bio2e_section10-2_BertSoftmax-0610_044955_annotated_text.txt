The <term>cell cycle</term> is an ordered <term>series</term> of <term>events</term> involving cell growth and <term>cell division</term> that produces two new <term>daughter cells</term>. <term>Cells</term> on the path to <term>cell division</term> proceed through a <term>series</term> of precisely timed and carefully regulated <term>stages</term> of growth, <term>DNA replication</term>, and nuclear and <term>cytoplasmic division</term> that ultimately produces two identical (clone) <term>cells</term>. The <term>cell cycle</term> has two major <term>phases</term>: <term>interphase</term> and the <term>mitotic phase</term> (Figure 10.5). During <term>interphase</term>, the <term>cell</term> grows and <term>DNA</term> is <term>replicated</term>. During the <term>mitotic phase</term>, the replicated DNA and <term>cytoplasmic contents</term> are separated, and the cell <term>cytoplasm</term> is typically <term>partitioned</term> by a third <term>process</term> of the <term>cell cycle</term> called <term>cytokinesis</term>. We should <term>note</term>, however, that <term>interphase</term> and <term>mitosis</term> (<term>karyokinesis</term>) may take place without <term>cytokinesis</term>, in which case <term>cells</term> with <term>multiple nuclei</term> (<term>multinucleate cells</term>) are produced.


During <term>interphase</term>, the <term>cell</term> undergoes <term>normal growth processes</term> while also preparing for <term>cell division</term>. In <term>order</term> for a <term>cell</term> to move from <term>interphase</term> into the <term>mitotic phase</term>, many internal and <term>external conditions</term> must be met. The three <term>stages</term> of <term>interphase</term> are called G1, S, and G2.


The first <term>stage</term> of <term>interphase</term> is called the <term>G1 phase</term> (<term>first gap</term>) because, from a microscopic point of view, little change is visible. However, during the G1 <term>stage</term>, the <term>cell</term> is quite active at the <term>biochemical level</term>. The <term>cell</term> is <term>accumulating</term> the building <term>blocks</term> of <term>chromosomal DNA</term> and the <term>associated proteins</term> as well as <term>accumulating</term> sufficient <term>energy reserves</term> to complete the task of <term>replicating</term> each <term>chromosome</term> in the <term>nucleus</term>.


Throughout <term>interphase</term>, <term>nuclear DNA</term> remains in a semi-condensed <term>chromatin configuration</term>. In the S <term>phase</term>, <term>DNA replication</term> can proceed through the mechanisms that result in the formation of identical pairs of <term>DNA molecules</term>—<term>sister chromatids</term>—that are firmly attached to the <term>centromeric region</term>. The <term>centrosome</term> is also duplicated during the S <term>phase</term>. The two <term>centrosomes</term> of <term>homologous chromosomes</term> will give rise to the <term>mitotic spindle</term>, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of <term>chromosomes</term> during <term>mitosis</term>. For example, roughly at the center of each <term>animal cell</term>, the <term>centrosomes</term> are associated with a pair of rod-like objects, the <term>centrioles</term>, which are <term>positioned</term> at right angles to each other. <term>Centrioles</term> help organize <term>cell division</term>. We should <term>note</term>, however, that <term>centrioles</term> are not present in the <term>centrosomes</term> of other <term>eukaryotic organisms</term>, such as plants and most <term>fungi</term>.


In the <term>G2 phase</term>, the <term>cell</term> replenishes its <term>energy stores</term> and <term>synthesizes</term> proteins necessary for <term>chromosome manipulation</term> and movement. Some <term>cell organelles</term> are duplicated, and the <term>cytoskeleton</term> is dismantled to provide resources for the <term>mitotic phase</term>. There may be additional <term>cell growth</term> during G2. The final preparations for the <term>mitotic phase</term> must be completed before the <term>cell</term> is able to enter the first <term>stage</term> of <term>mitosis</term>.


The <term>mitotic phase</term> is a <term>multistep process</term> during which the <term>duplicated chromosomes</term> are aligned, separated, and move into two new, identical <term>daughter cells</term>. The first portion of the <term>mitotic phase</term> is called <term>karyokinesis</term>, or <term>nuclear division</term>. As we have just seen, the second portion of the <term>mitotic phase</term> (and often viewed as a <term>process</term> separate from and following <term>mitosis</term>) is called <term>cytokinesis</term>—the <term>physical separation</term> of the <term>cytoplasmic components</term> into the two <term>daughter cells</term>.


<term>Karyokinesis</term>, also known as <term>mitosis</term>, is divided into a <term>series</term> of <term>phases</term>—<term>prophase</term>, <term>prometaphase</term>, <term>metaphase</term>, <term>anaphase</term>, and <term>telophase</term>—that result in the <term>division</term> of the <term>cell nucleus</term> (Figure 10.6).


<term>Karyokinesis</term> (or <term>mitosis</term>) is divided into five <term>stages</term>—<term>prophase</term>, <term>prometaphase</term>, <term>metaphase</term>, <term>anaphase</term>, and <term>telophase</term>. The pictures at the bottom were taken by <term>fluorescence microscopy</term> (hence, the <term>black background</term>) of <term>cells</term> artificially stained by <term>fluorescent dyes</term>: blue <term>fluorescence</term> indicates <term>DNA</term> (<term>chromosomes</term>) and green <term>fluorescence</term> indicates <term>microtubules</term> (<term>spindle apparatus</term>). (<term>credit “mitosis drawings</term>”: modification of <term>work</term> by Mariana Ruiz <term>Villareal</term>; <term>credit “micrographs</term>”: modification of <term>work</term> by Roy <term>van Heesbeen</term>; <term>credit “cytokinesis micrograph</term>”: Wadsworth Center/New York State Department of Health; scale-bar data from Matt <term>Russell</term>)


<term>Prophase</term> (the “first <term>phase</term>”): the <term>nuclear envelope</term> starts to dissociate into <term>small vesicles</term>, and the <term>membranous organelles</term> (such as the <term>Golgi complex</term> [<term>Golgi apparatus</term>] and the <term>endoplasmic reticulum</term>), <term>fragment</term> and <term>disperse</term> toward the <term>periphery</term> of the <term>cell</term>. The nucleolus disappears (<term>disperses</term>) as well, and the <term>centrosomes</term> begin to move to opposite poles of the <term>cell</term>. <term>Microtubules</term> that will form the mitotic spindle extend between the <term>centrosomes</term>, pushing them farther apart as the <term>microtubule fibers</term> lengthen. The <term>sister chromatids</term> begin to coil more tightly with the aid of <term>condensin proteins</term> and now become visible under a <term>light microscope</term>.


<term>Prometaphase</term> (the “first change <term>phase</term>”): Many <term>processes</term> that began in <term>prophase</term> continue to advance. The remnants of the <term>nuclear envelope fragment</term> further, and the <term>mitotic spindle</term> continues to develop as more <term>microtubules</term> assemble and stretch across the length of the former <term>nuclear area</term>. <term>Chromosomes</term> become even more condensed and discrete. Each <term>sister chromatid</term> develops a <term>protein structure</term> called a <term>kinetochore</term> in its <term>centromeric region</term> (Figure 10.7). The proteins of the <term>kinetochore</term> attract and <term>bind</term> to the <term>mitotic spindle microtubules</term>. As the <term>spindle microtubules</term> extend from the <term>centrosomes</term>, some of these <term>microtubules</term> come into contact with and firmly <term>bind</term> to the <term>kinetochores</term>. Once a <term>mitotic fiber</term> attaches to a <term>chromosome</term>, the <term>chromosome</term> will be oriented until the <term>kinetochores</term> of <term>sister chromatids</term> face the opposite poles. Eventually, all the <term>sister chromatids</term> will be attached via their <term>kinetochores</term> to <term>microtubules</term> from opposing poles. <term>Spindle microtubules</term> that do not engage the <term>chromosomes</term> are called <term>polar microtubules</term>. These <term>microtubules</term> <term>overlap</term> each other midway between the two poles and contribute to <term>cell elongation</term>. <term>Astral microtubules</term> are located near the poles, aid in <term>spindle orientation</term>, and are required for the <term>regulation</term> of <term>mitosis</term>.


<term>Metaphase</term> (the <term>“change phase</term>”): All the <term>chromosomes</term> are aligned in a <term>plane</term> called the <term>metaphase plate</term>, or the <term>equatorial plane</term>, roughly midway between the two poles of the <term>cell</term>. The <term>sister chromatids</term> are still tightly attached to each other by <term>cohesin proteins</term>. At this time, the <term>chromosomes</term> are maximally condensed.


<term>Anaphase</term> (“upward <term>phase</term>”): The <term>cohesin proteins</term> degrade, and the <term>sister chromatids</term> separate at the <term>centromere</term>. Each <term>chromatid</term>, now called a <term>single chromosome</term>, is pulled rapidly toward the <term>centrosome</term> to which its <term>microtubule</term> is attached. The <term>cell</term> becomes visibly elongated (oval shaped) as the <term>polar microtubules</term> slide against each other at the <term>metaphase plate</term> where they <term>overlap</term>.


<term>Telophase</term> (the “distance <term>phase</term>”): the <term>chromosomes</term> reach the opposite poles and begin to <term>decondense</term> (unravel), relaxing once again into a stretched-out <term>chromatin configuration</term>. The <term>mitotic spindles</term> are <term>depolymerized</term> into <term>tubulin monomers</term> that will be used to assemble <term>cytoskeletal components</term> for each <term>daughter cell</term>. <term>Nuclear envelopes</term> form around the <term>chromosomes</term>, and <term>nucleosomes</term> appear within the <term>nuclear area</term>.


<term>Cytokinesis</term>, or <term>“cell motion</term>,” is sometimes viewed as the second <term>main stage</term> of the <term>mitotic phase</term>, during which <term>cell division</term> is completed via the <term>physical separation</term> of the <term>cytoplasmic components</term> into two <term>daughter cells</term> However, as we have seen earlier, <term>cytokinesis</term> can also be viewed as a separate <term>phase</term>, which may or may not take place following <term>mitosis</term>. If <term>cytokinesis</term> does take place, <term>cell division</term> is not complete until the <term>cell components</term> have been apportioned and completely separated into the two <term>daughter cells</term>. Although the <term>stages</term> of <term>mitosis</term> are similar for most <term>eukaryotes</term>, the <term>process</term> of <term>cytokinesis</term> is quite different for <term>eukaryotes</term> that have <term>cell walls</term>, such as <term>plant cells</term>.


In <term>animal cells</term>, <term>cytokinesis</term> typically starts during late <term>anaphase</term>. A <term>contractile ring</term> composed of actin filaments forms just inside the <term>plasma membrane</term> at the former <term>metaphase plate</term>. The <term>actin filaments</term> pull the equator of the <term>cell</term> inward, forming a <term>fissure</term>. This <term>fissure</term> is called the <term>cleavage furrow</term>. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the <term>membrane</term> is cleaved in two (Figure 10.8).


In <term>plant cells</term>, a new <term>cell wall</term> must form between the <term>daughter cells</term>. During <term>interphase</term>, the <term>Golgi apparatus</term> <term>accumulates</term> <term>enzymes</term>, <term>structural proteins</term>, and <term>glucose molecules</term> prior to breaking into <term>vesicles</term> and <term>dispersing</term> throughout the dividing <term>cell</term>. During <term>telophase</term>, these <term>Golgi vesicles</term> are transported on <term>microtubules</term> to form a <term>phragmoplast</term> (a <term>vesicular structure</term>) at the <term>metaphase plate</term>. There, the vesicles fuse and coalesce from the center toward the <term>cell walls</term>; this structure is called a <term>cell plate</term>. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the <term>cell walls</term> at the <term>periphery</term> of the <term>cell</term>. <term>Enzymes</term> use the <term>glucose</term> that has <term>accumulated</term> between the membrane layers to build a new <term>cell wall</term>. The <term>Golgi membranes</term> become parts of the <term>plasma membrane</term> on either side of the new <term>cell wall</term> (Figure 10.8).


Not all <term>cells</term> adhere to the <term>classic cell-cycle pattern</term> in which a newly formed <term>daughter cell</term> immediately enters the <term>preparatory phases of interphase</term>, closely followed by the <term>mitotic phase</term>, and <term>cytokinesis</term>. <term>Cells</term> in G0 <term>phase</term> are not actively preparing to divide. The <term>cell</term> is in a quiescent (inactive) <term>stage</term> that occurs when <term>cells</term> exit the <term>cell cycle</term>. Some <term>cells</term> enter G0 temporarily due to environmental conditions such as availability of nutrients, or stimulation by <term>growth factors</term>. The <term>cell</term> will remain in this <term>phase</term> until conditions improve or until an external signal triggers the onset of G1. Other <term>cells</term> that never or rarely divide, such as <term>mature cardiac muscle</term> and <term>nerve cells</term>, remain in G0 permanently.
