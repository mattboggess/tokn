<term>Cells</term> fall into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. We classify only the predominantly single-celled organisms <term>Bacteria</term> and <term>Archaea</term> as <term>prokaryotes</term> (pro- = “before”; -kary- = “<term>nucleus</term>”). <term>Animal cells</term>, plants, <term>fungi</term>, and <term>protists</term> are all <term>eukaryotes</term> (eu- = “true”).


All <term>cells</term> share four common components: 1) a <term>plasma membrane</term>, an outer covering that separates the cell’s interior from its surrounding <term>environment</term>; 2) <term>cytoplasm</term>, consisting of a jelly-like <term>cytosol</term> within the <term>cell</term> in which there are other cellular components; 3) <term>DNA</term>, the <term>cell</term>'s <term>genetic material</term>; and 4) <term>ribosomes</term>, which synthesize <term>proteins</term>. However, <term>prokaryotes</term> differ from <term>eukaryotic cells</term> in several ways.


A <term>prokaryote</term> is a simple, mostly single-celled (unicellular) <term>organism</term> that <term>lacks</term> a <term>nucleus</term>, or any other membrane-bound <term>organelle</term>. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in <term>eukaryotes</term>. <term>Prokaryotic DNA</term> is in the <term>cell</term>'s central part: the nucleoid (Figure 4.5).


Most <term>prokaryotes</term> have a peptidoglycan cell wall and many have a <term>polysaccharide capsule</term> (Figure 4.5). The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the <term>cell</term> maintain its shape, and prevents <term>dehydration</term>. The <term>capsule</term> enables the <term>cell</term> to attach to surfaces in its <term>environment</term>. Some <term>prokaryotes</term> have <term>flagella</term>, <term>pili</term>, or <term>fimbriae</term>. <term>Flagella</term> are used for <term>locomotion</term>. Pili exchange <term>genetic material</term> during <term>conjugation</term>, the process by which one bacterium transfers <term>genetic material</term> to another through <term>direct contact</term>. <term>Bacteria</term> use <term>fimbriae</term> to attach to a <term>host cell</term>.


The most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of <term>contagious illnesses</term> is to wash his or her hands. Why? Because <term>microbes</term> (<term>organisms</term> so tiny that they can only be seen with <term>microscopes</term>) are ubiquitous. They live on <term>doorknobs</term>, money, your hands, and many other surfaces. If someone sneezes into his hand and touches a <term>doorknob</term>, and afterwards you touch that same <term>doorknob</term>, the <term>microbes</term> from the sneezer’s <term>mucus</term> are now on your hands. If you touch your hands to your mouth, <term>nose</term>, or <term>eyes</term>, those <term>microbes</term> can enter your <term>body</term> and could make you sick.


However, not all <term>microbes</term> (also called <term>microorganisms</term>) cause <term>disease</term>; most are actually beneficial. You have <term>microbes</term> in your <term>gut</term> that make vitamin K. Other <term>microorganisms</term> are used to ferment beer and wine.


<term>Microbiologists</term> are scientists who study <term>microbes</term>. <term>Microbiologists</term> can pursue a number of careers. Not only do they <term>work</term> in the food industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. They can <term>work</term> in the pharmaceutical <term>sector</term>, serving key roles in research and <term>development</term> by identifying new antibiotic sources that can treat <term>bacterial infections</term>.


Environmental <term>microbiologists</term> may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered <term>microbes</term> to remove <term>pollutants</term> from <term>soil</term> or groundwater, as well as hazardous <term>elements</term> from contaminated sites. We call using these microbes bioremediation technologies. <term>Microbiologists</term> can also <term>work</term> in the <term>bioinformatics field</term>, providing specialized knowledge and insight for designing, developing, and <term>specificity</term> of computer <term>models</term> of, for example, bacterial epidemics.


At 0.1 to 5.0 <term>μm</term> in diameter, <term>prokaryotic cells</term> are significantly smaller than <term>eukaryotic cells</term>, which have diameters <term>ranging</term> from 10 to 100 <term>μm</term> (Figure 4.6). The <term>prokaryotes</term>' small size allows <term>ions</term> and <term>organic molecules</term> that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the <term>cell</term>. Similarly, any <term>wastes</term> produced within a <term>prokaryotic cell</term> can quickly diffuse. This is not the case in <term>eukaryotic cells</term>, which have developed different structural <term>adaptations</term> to enhance <term>intracellular transport</term>.


Small size, in general, is necessary for all <term>cells</term>, whether prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Let’s examine why that is so. First, we’ll consider the area and volume of a typical <term>cell</term>. Not all <term>cells</term> are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere. You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the surface area of a sphere is 4πr2, while the formula for its volume is 4πr3/3. Thus, as the radius of a cell increases, its surface area increases as the square of its radius, but its volume increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). Therefore, as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to<term>-volume ratio</term> decreases. This same principle would apply if the <term>cell</term> had a cube shape (Figure 4.7). If the <term>cell</term> grows too large, the <term>plasma membrane</term> will not have sufficient surface area to support the rate of <term>diffusion</term> required for the increased volume. In other words, as a <term>cell</term> grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become more efficient is to divide. Other ways are to increase surface area by foldings of the <term>cell membrane</term>, become flat or thin and elongated, or develop <term>organelles</term> that perform specific tasks. These <term>adaptations</term> lead to developing more sophisticated <term>cells</term>, which we call <term>eukaryotic cells</term>.


Notice that as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to<term>-volume ratio</term> decreases. When there is insufficient surface area to support a cell’s increasing volume, a <term>cell</term> will either divide or die. The <term>cell</term> on the left has a volume of 1 <term>mm3</term> and a surface area of 6 <term>mm2</term>, with a surface area-to<term>-volume ratio</term> of 6 to 1; whereas, the <term>cell</term> on the right has a volume of 8 <term>mm3</term> and a surface area of 24 <term>mm2</term>, with a surface area-to<term>-volume ratio</term> of 3 to 1.
