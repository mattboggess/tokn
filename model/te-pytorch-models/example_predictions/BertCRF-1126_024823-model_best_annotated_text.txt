Ribosomes transfer their newly synthesized <entity>proteins</entity> into the <entity>RER</entity>'s <entity>lumen</entity> where they undergo structural modifications, such as folding or acquiring <entity>side</entity> <entity>chains</entity>. These modified <entity>proteins</entity> incorporate into cellular <entity>membranes</entity> — the ER or the ER's or other organelles' <entity>membranes</entity>. The <entity>proteins</entity> can also secrete from the cell (such as <entity>protein</entity> <entity>hormones</entity>, <entity>enzymes</entity>). The <entity>RER</entity> also makes <entity>phospholipids</entity> for cellular <entity>membranes</entity>. If the <entity>phospholipids</entity> or modified <entity>proteins</entity> are not destined to stay in the <entity>RER</entity>, they will reach their destinations via <entity>transport</entity> <entity>vesicles</entity> that bud from the <entity>RER</entity>’s <entity>membrane</entity> (Figure 4.18).
