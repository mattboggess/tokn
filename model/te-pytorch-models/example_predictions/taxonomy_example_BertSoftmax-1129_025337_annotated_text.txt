Cells fall into one of two broad categories: <entity>prokaryotic</entity> and <entity>eukaryotic</entity>. We classify only the predominantly single-celled organisms bacteria and <entity>archaea</entity> as <entity>prokaryotes</entity> (pro- = “before”; -kary- = “<entity>nucleus</entity>”). Animal cells, plants, fungi, and <entity>protists</entity> are all <entity>eukaryotes</entity> (eu- = “true”).
