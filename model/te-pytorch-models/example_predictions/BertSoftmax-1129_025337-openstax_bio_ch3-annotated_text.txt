A <entity>cell</entity> is the smallest <entity>unit</entity> of a <event>living</event> thing. Whether comprised of one <entity>cell</entity> (like <entity>bacteria</entity>) or many <entity>cells</entity> (like a <entity>human</entity>), we call it an organism. Thus, <entity>cells</entity> are the <entity>basic</entity> building blocks of all <entity>organisms</entity>.

Several <entity>cells</entity> of one kind that interconnect with each other and perform a shared <entity>function form tissues</entity>. These <entity>tissues</entity> combine to <entity>form</entity> an <entity>organ</entity> (your stomach, <entity>heart</entity>, or brain), and several <entity>organs</entity> comprise an <entity>organ system</entity> (such as the <entity>digestive system</entity>, <entity>circulatory system</entity>, or <entity>nervous system</entity>). Several <entity>systems</entity> that <entity>function</entity> together <entity>form</entity> an organism (like a <entity>human</entity> being). Here, we will examine the <entity>structure</entity> and <entity>function</entity> of <entity>cells</entity>.

There are many types of <entity>cells</entity>, which scientists <entity>group</entity> into one of <entity>two</entity> broad categories: <entity>prokaryotic</entity> and <entity>eukaryotic</entity>. For example, we classify both <entity>animal</entity> and <entity>plant cells</entity> as <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity>; whereas, we classify <entity>bacterial cells</entity> as <entity>prokaryotic</entity>. Before discussing the criteria for determining whether a <entity>cell</entity> is <entity>prokaryotic</entity> or <entity>eukaryotic</entity>, we will first examine how biologists <entity>study</entity> <entity>cells</entity>.

Microscopy
<entity>Cells</entity> vary in size. With few exceptions, we cannot see individual <entity>cells</entity> with the naked eye, so scientists use <entity>microscopes</entity> (micro- = “<entity>small</entity>”; -scope = “to look at”) to <entity>study</entity> them. A <entity>microscope</entity> is an instrument that <event>magnifies</event> an object. We photograph most <entity>cells</entity> with a <entity>microscope</entity>, so we can call these images <entity>micrographs</entity>.

The <entity>optics</entity> of a <entity>microscope</entity>’s <entity>lenses</entity> <entity>change</entity> the image orientation that the user sees. A specimen that is right-<entity>side</entity> up and <entity>facing</entity> right on the <entity>microscope</entity> slide will appear upside-down and <entity>facing</entity> left when one views through a <entity>microscope</entity>, and vice versa. Similarly, if one moves the slide left while looking through the <entity>microscope</entity>, it will appear to move right, and if one moves it down, it will seem to move up. This occurs because <entity>microscopes</entity> use <entity>two</entity> sets of <entity>lenses</entity> to <event>magnify</event> the image. Because of the manner by which <entity>light</entity> travels through the <entity>lenses</entity>, this <entity>two lens system</entity> produces an inverted image (<entity>binocular</entity>, or <event>dissecting</event> <entity>microscopes</entity>, <entity>work</entity> in a similar manner, but include an additional <entity>magnification system</entity> that makes the final image appear to be upright).

<entity>Light</entity> Microscopes
To give you a <entity>sense</entity> of <entity>cell</entity> size, a typical <entity>human red blood cell</entity> is about eight millionths of a meter or eight <entity>micrometers</entity> (abbreviated as eight μm) in diameter. A <entity>pin head</entity> is about <entity>two</entity> thousandths of a meter (<entity>two</entity> mm) in diameter. That means about 250 <entity>red blood cells</entity> could fit on a pinhead.

Most <entity>student microscopes</entity> are <entity>light microscopes</entity> (Figure 4.2a). Visible <entity>light</entity> passes and bends through the <entity>lens system</entity> to enable the user to see the specimen. <entity>Light microscopes</entity> are advantageous for viewing <entity>living organisms</entity>, but since individual <entity>cells</entity> are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with <entity>special stains</entity>. Staining, however, usually kills the <entity>cells</entity>.

<entity>Light microscopes</entity> that <entity>undergraduates</entity> commonly use in the laboratory <event>magnify</event> up to approximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in <entity>microscopy</entity> are <event>magnification</event> and resolving <entity>power</entity>. <event>Magnification</event> is the process of enlarging an object in appearance. Resolving <entity>power</entity> is the <entity>microscope</entity>'s ability to distinguish <entity>two</entity> adjacent <entity>structures</entity> as separate: the higher the <entity>resolution</entity>, the better the image's clarity and detail. When one uses oil immersion <entity>lenses</entity> to <entity>study</entity> <entity>small</entity> objects, <event>magnification</event> usually increases to 1,000 times. In <entity>order</entity> to gain a better understanding of <entity>cellular structure</entity> and <entity>function</entity>, scientists typically use <entity>electron microscopes</entity>.

Part a: This <entity>light microscope</entity> has <entity>binocular lenses</entity> and four <entity>objective lenses</entity>. The sample <entity>stage</entity> is directly beneath the <entity>objective lens</entity>. The <entity>light microscope</entity> sits on a tabletop and can be easily <event>carried</event>. Part b: The <entity>electron microscope</entity> shown here sits in a museum. It is about the size of a desk, and a person can sit in front of it to operate it. A column taller than a person rises from the <entity>center</entity> of the scope.
Figure 4.2 (a) Most <entity>light microscopes</entity> in a college <entity>biology</entity> lab can <event>magnify</event> <entity>cells</entity> up to approximately 400 times and have a <entity>resolution</entity> of about 200 <entity>nanometers</entity>. (b) <entity>Electron microscopes</entity> provide a much higher <event>magnification</event>, 100,000x, and a have a <entity>resolution</entity> of 50 <entity>picometers</entity>.

<entity>Electron</entity> Microscopes
In <entity>contrast</entity> to <entity>light microscopes</entity>, <entity>electron microscopes</entity> (Figure 4.2b) use a <entity>beam</entity> of <entity>electrons</entity> instead of a <entity>beam</entity> of <entity>light</entity>. Not only does this allow for higher <event>magnification</event> and, thus, more detail (Figure 4.3), it also provides higher resolving <entity>power</entity>. The method to prepare the specimen for viewing with an <entity>electron microscope</entity> kills the specimen. Electrons have short wavelengths (shorter than <entity>photons</entity>) that move best in a vacuum, so we cannot view <event>living</event> <entity>cells</entity> with an <entity>electron microscope</entity>.

In a <entity>scanning electron microscope</entity>, a <entity>beam</entity> of <entity>electrons</entity> moves back and forth across a <entity>cell</entity>’s <entity>surface</entity>, creating details of <entity>cell surface</entity> characteristics. In a <entity>transmission electron microscope</entity>, the <entity>electron beam</entity> penetrates the <entity>cell</entity> and provides details of a <entity>cell</entity>’s <entity>internal structures</entity>. As you might imagine, <entity>electron microscopes</entity> are significantly more bulky and expensive than <entity>light microscopes</entity>.

Part a: <entity>Salmonella</entity> through a <entity>light microscope</entity> appear as tiny purple dots. Part b: In this <entity>scanning electron micrograph</entity>, <entity>bacteria</entity> appear as three-dimensional ovals. The <entity>human cells</entity> are much larger with a <entity>complex</entity>, folded appearance. Some of the <entity>bacteria</entity> lie on the <entity>surface</entity> of the <entity>human cells</entity>, and some are squeezed between them.

(b) This <entity>scanning electron microscope micrograph</entity> shows <entity>Salmonella bacteria</entity> (in <entity>red</entity>) invading <entity>human cells</entity> (yellow). Even though subfigure (b) shows a different <entity>Salmonella</entity> specimen than subfigure (a), you can still observe the comparative increase in <event>magnification</event> and detail.

<entity>Cell</entity> Theory
The <entity>microscopes</entity> we use today are far more <entity>complex</entity> than those that Dutch shopkeeper Antony van Leeuwenhoek, used in the 1600s. Skilled in crafting <entity>lenses</entity>, van Leeuwenhoek observed the <event>movements</event> of <entity>single</entity>-<entity>celled</entity> <entity>organisms</entity>, which he collectively termed “<entity>animalcules</entity>.”

In the 1665 publication Micrographia, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “<entity>cell</entity>” for the box-like <entity>structures</entity> he observed when viewing <entity>cork tissue</entity> through a <entity>lens</entity>. In the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek discovered <entity>bacteria</entity> and <entity>protozoa</entity>. Later advances in <entity>lenses</entity>, <entity>microscope</entity> construction, and <entity>staining</entity> techniques enabled other scientists to see some components inside <entity>cells</entity>.

By the late 1830s, botanist Matthias Schleiden and zoologist Theodor Schwann were <entity>studying</entity> <entity>tissues</entity> and proposed the unified <entity>cell theory</entity>, which states that one or more <entity>cells</entity> comprise all <event>living</event> things, the <entity>cell</entity> is the <entity>basic unit</entity> of <entity>life</entity>, and new <entity>cells</entity> arise from existing <entity>cells</entity>. Rudolf Virchow later made important contributions to this <entity>theory</entity>.

<entity>CAREER</entity> CONNECTION
Cytotechnologist
Have you ever heard of a medical <entity>test</entity> called a Pap <entity>smear</entity> (Figure 4.4)? In this <entity>test</entity>, a doctor takes a <entity>small</entity> sample of <entity>cells</entity> from the patient's <entity>uterine cervix</entity> and sends it to a medical lab where a <entity>cytotechnologist</entity> <entity>stains</entity> the <entity>cells</entity> and examines them for any <entity>changes</entity> that could indicate <entity>cervical</entity> cancer or a <entity>microbial infection</entity>.

Cytotechnologists (<entity>cyto</entity>- = “<entity>cell</entity>”) are professionals who <entity>study</entity> <entity>cells</entity> via microscopic <entity>examinations</entity> and other laboratory <entity>tests</entity>. They are trained to determine which <entity>cellular changes</entity> are within <entity>normal limits</entity> and which are abnormal. Their <entity>focus</entity> is not <entity>limited</entity> to <entity>cervical cells</entity>. They <entity>study</entity> <entity>cellular</entity> specimens that come from all <entity>organs</entity>. When they notice abnormalities, they consult a pathologist, a medical doctor who interprets and diagnoses <entity>changes</entity> that <entity>disease</entity> in <entity>body tissue</entity> and fluids <event>cause</event>.

Cytotechnologists play a <entity>vital</entity> role in saving people’s <entity>lives</entity>. When doctors discover abnormalities early, a patient’s treatment can begin sooner, which usually increases the chances of a successful outcome.

Both <entity>normal cells</entity> and <entity>cells</entity> <event>infected</event> with <entity>HPV</entity> have an irregular, round shape and a well-defined <entity>nucleus</entity>. <event>Infected</event> <entity>cells</entity>, however, are <entity>two</entity> to three times as large as <entity>uninfected cells</entity>, and some have <entity>two</entity> nuclei.
Figure 4.4 These <entity>uterine cervix cells</entity>, viewed through a <entity>light microscope</entity>, are from a Pap <entity>smear</entity>. <entity>Normal cells</entity> are on the left. The <entity>cells</entity> on the right are <event>infected</event> with <entity>human papillomavirus</entity> (<entity>HPV</entity>). Notice that the <event>infected</event> <entity>cells</entity> are larger. Also, <entity>two</entity> of these <entity>cells</entity> each have <entity>two</entity> nuclei instead of one, the <entity>normal number</entity>.

By the end of this <entity>section</entity>, you will be able to do the <event>following</event>:
Name examples of <entity>prokaryotic</entity> and <entity>eukaryotic</entity> organisms
Compare and <entity>contrast</entity> <entity>prokaryotic</entity> and <entity>eukaryotic</entity> cells
Describe the relative sizes of different cells
Explain why <entity>cells</entity> must be small
<entity>Cells</entity> fall into one of <entity>two</entity> broad categories: <entity>prokaryotic</entity> and <entity>eukaryotic</entity>. We classify only the predominantly <entity>single</entity>-<entity>celled</entity> <entity>organisms Bacteria</entity> and <entity>Archaea</entity> as <entity>prokaryotes</entity> (pro- = “before”; -kary- = “<entity>nucleus</entity>”). <entity>Animal cells</entity>, <entity>plants</entity>, fungi, and <entity>protists</entity> are all <entity>eukaryotes</entity> (eu- = “<entity>true</entity>”).

Components of <entity>Prokaryotic</entity> Cells
All <entity>cells</entity> share four common components: 1) a <entity>plasma membrane</entity>, an <entity>outer</entity> covering that separates the <entity>cell</entity>’s interior from its surrounding environment; 2) <entity>cytoplasm</entity>, consisting of a jelly-like <entity>cytosol</entity> within the <entity>cell</entity> in which there are other <entity>cellular</entity> components; 3) <entity>DNA</entity>, the <entity>cell</entity>'s <entity>genetic</entity> material; and 4) <entity>ribosomes</entity>, which synthesize <entity>proteins</entity>. However, <entity>prokaryotes</entity> differ from <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity> in several ways.

A <entity>prokaryote</entity> is a simple, mostly <entity>single</entity>-<entity>celled</entity> (unicellular) organism that lacks a <entity>nucleus</entity>, or any other <entity>membrane-bound organelle</entity>. We will shortly come to see that this is significantly different in <entity>eukaryotes</entity>. <entity>Prokaryotic DNA</entity> is in the <entity>cell</entity>'s <entity>central</entity> part: the <entity>nucleoid</entity> (Figure 4.5).

In this illustration, the <entity>prokaryotic cell</entity> has an oval shape. The <entity>circular chromosome</entity> is <event>concentrated</event> in a <entity>region</entity> called the <entity>nucleoid</entity>. The fluid inside the <entity>cell</entity> is called the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. <entity>Ribosomes</entity>, depicted as <entity>small</entity> circles, float in the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. The <entity>cytoplasm</entity> is encased by a <entity>plasma membrane</entity>, which in turn is encased by a <entity>cell</entity> wall. A <entity>capsule</entity> surrounds the <entity>cell</entity> wall. The bacterium depicted has a <entity>flagellum</entity> protruding from one narrow end. Pili are <entity>small protrusions</entity> that <entity>project</entity> from the <entity>capsule</entity> in all directions.
Figure 4.5 This figure shows the <event>generalized</event> <entity>structure</entity> of a <entity>prokaryotic cell</entity>. All <entity>prokaryotes</entity> have <entity>chromosomal DNA</entity> localized in a <entity>nucleoid</entity>, <entity>ribosomes</entity>, a <entity>cell membrane</entity>, and a <entity>cell</entity> wall. The other <entity>structures</entity> shown are present in some, but not all, <entity>bacteria</entity>.
Most <entity>prokaryotes</entity> have a <entity>peptidoglycan cell</entity> wall and many have a <entity>polysaccharide capsule</entity> (Figure 4.5). The <entity>cell</entity> wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the <entity>cell</entity> maintain its shape, and prevents <event>dehydration</event>. The <entity>capsule</entity> enables the <entity>cell</entity> to attach to <entity>surfaces</entity> in its environment. Some <entity>prokaryotes</entity> have <entity>flagella</entity>, pili, or <entity>fimbriae</entity>. <entity>Flagella</entity> are used for <entity>locomotion</entity>. Pili exchange <entity>genetic</entity> material during <event>conjugation</event>, the process by which one bacterium transfers <entity>genetic</entity> material to another through direct <entity>contact</entity>. <entity>Bacteria</entity> use <entity>fimbriae</entity> to attach to a <entity>host cell</entity>.

<entity>CAREER</entity> CONNECTION
Microbiologist
The most effective action anyone can take to prevent the spread of <entity>contagious</entity> illnesses is to wash his or her hands. Why? Because <entity>microbes</entity> (<entity>organisms</entity> so tiny that they can only be seen with <entity>microscopes</entity>) are ubiquitous. They live on <entity>doorknobs</entity>, money, your hands, and many other <entity>surfaces</entity>. If someone sneezes into his hand and touches a <entity>doorknob</entity>, and afterwards you touch that same <entity>doorknob</entity>, the <entity>microbes</entity> from the <entity>sneezer</entity>’s <entity>mucus</entity> are now on your hands. If you touch your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes, those <entity>microbes</entity> can enter your <entity>body</entity> and could make you sick.

However, not all <entity>microbes</entity> (also called <entity>microorganisms</entity>) <event>cause</event> <entity>disease</entity>; most are actually beneficial. You have <entity>microbes</entity> in your gut that make <entity>vitamin</entity> K. Other <entity>microorganisms</entity> are used to ferment beer and wine.

<entity>Microbiologists</entity> are scientists who <entity>study</entity> <entity>microbes</entity>. <entity>Microbiologists</entity> can pursue a <entity>number</entity> of <entity>careers</entity>. Not only do they <entity>work</entity> in the food industry, they are also employed in the veterinary and medical fields. They can <entity>work</entity> in the pharmaceutical sector, serving key roles in research and <event>development</event> by identifying new antibiotic sources that can treat <entity>bacterial infections</entity>.

Environmental <entity>microbiologists</entity> may look for new ways to use specially selected or genetically engineered <entity>microbes</entity> to remove pollutants from soil or groundwater, as well as <entity>hazardous elements</entity> from contaminated sites. We call using these <event>microbes bioremediation</event> technologies. <entity>Microbiologists</entity> can also <entity>work</entity> in the bioinformatics field, providing specialized knowledge and insight for designing, developing, and <entity>specificity</entity> of computer <entity>models</entity> of, for example, <entity>bacterial</entity> epidemics.

<entity>Cell</entity> Size
At 0.1 to 5.0 μm in diameter, <entity>prokaryotic cells</entity> are significantly smaller than <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity>, which have diameters ranging from 10 to 100 μm (Figure 4.6). The <entity>prokaryotes</entity>' <entity>small</entity> size allows <entity>ions</entity> and <entity>organic molecules</entity> that enter them to quickly diffuse to other parts of the <entity>cell</entity>. Similarly, any wastes produced within a <entity>prokaryotic cell</entity> can quickly diffuse. This is not the case in <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity>, which have developed different <entity>structural</entity> adaptations to enhance <entity>intracellular transport</entity>.

Part a: Relative sizes on a <entity>logarithmic scale</entity>, from 0.1 n m to 1 m, are shown. Objects are shown from smallest to largest. The smallest object shown, an <entity>atom</entity>, is about 1 n m in size. The next largest objects shown are <entity>lipids</entity> and <entity>proteins</entity>; these <entity>molecules</entity> are between 1 and 10 n m. <entity>Bacteria</entity> are about 100 n m, and <entity>mitochondria</entity> are about 1 <entity>greek</entity> mu m. <entity>Plant</entity> and <entity>animal cells</entity> are both between 10 and 100 <entity>greek</entity> mu m. A <entity>human</entity> egg is between 100 <entity>greek</entity> mu m and 1 m m. A frog egg is about 1 m m, A chicken egg and an <entity>ostrich</entity> egg are both between 10 and 100 m m, but a chicken egg is larger. For comparison, a <entity>human</entity> is approximately 1 m tall.
Figure 4.6 This figure shows relative sizes of <entity>microbes</entity> on a <entity>logarithmic scale</entity> (recall that each <entity>unit</entity> of increase in a <entity>logarithmic scale</entity> represents a 10-fold increase in the quantity measured).
<entity>Small</entity> size, in general, is necessary for all <entity>cells</entity>, whether <entity>prokaryotic</entity> or <entity>eukaryotic</entity>. Let’s examine why that is so. First, we’ll consider the area and <entity>volume</entity> of a typical <entity>cell</entity>. Not all <entity>cells</entity> are spherical in shape, but most tend to approximate a sphere. You may remember from your high school geometry course that the formula for the <entity>surface</entity> area of a sphere is 4πr2, while the formula for its <entity>volume</entity> is 4πr3/3. Thus, as the radius of a <entity>cell</entity> increases, its <entity>surface</entity> area increases as the square of its radius, but its <entity>volume</entity> increases as the cube of its radius (much more rapidly). Therefore, as a <entity>cell</entity> increases in size, its <entity>surface</entity> area-to-<entity>volume</entity> ratio decreases. This same principle would apply if the <entity>cell</entity> had a cube shape (Figure 4.7). If the <entity>cell</entity> grows too large, the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> will not have sufficient <entity>surface</entity> area to support the rate of diffusion required for the increased <entity>volume</entity>. In other words, as a <entity>cell</entity> grows, it becomes less efficient. One way to become more efficient is to <event>divide</event>. Another way is to develop <entity>organelles</entity> that perform specific tasks. These adaptations lead to developing more sophisticated <entity>cells</entity>, which we call <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity>.

<entity>VISUAL</entity> CONNECTION
On the left, a sphere 1 mm in diameter is encased in a box of the same width. On the right, the same sphere is encased in a box 2 mm in diameter.
Figure 4.7 Notice that as a <entity>cell</entity> increases in size, its <entity>surface</entity> area-to-<entity>volume</entity> ratio decreases. When there is insufficient <entity>surface</entity> area to support a <entity>cell</entity>’s increasing <entity>volume</entity>, a <entity>cell</entity> will either <event>divide</event> or die. The <entity>cell</entity> on the left has a <entity>volume</entity> of 1 mm3 and a <entity>surface</entity> area of 6 mm2, with a <entity>surface</entity> area-to-<entity>volume</entity> ratio of 6 to 1; whereas, the <entity>cell</entity> on the right has a <entity>volume</entity> of 8 mm3 and a <entity>surface</entity> area of 24 mm2, with a <entity>surface</entity> area-to-<entity>volume</entity> ratio of 3 to 1.
<entity>Prokaryotic cells</entity> are much smaller than <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity>. What advantages might <entity>small cell</entity> size confer on a <entity>cell</entity>? What advantages might large <entity>cell</entity> size have?

By the end of this <entity>section</entity>, you will be able to do the <event>following</event>:
Describe the <entity>structure</entity> of <entity>eukaryotic</entity> cells
Compare <entity>animal cells</entity> with <entity>plant</entity> cells
State the role of the <entity>plasma</entity> membrane
Summarize the <entity>functions</entity> of the <entity>major cell</entity> organelles
Have you ever heard the phrase “<entity>form</entity> <event>follows</event> <entity>function</entity>?” It’s a <entity>philosophy</entity> that many industries <event>follow</event>. In architecture, this means that buildings should be constructed to support the <entity>activities</entity> that will be <event>carried</event> out inside them. For example, a skyscraper should include several elevator banks. A hospital should have its <entity>emergency room</entity> easily accessible.

Our natural world also utilizes the principle of <entity>form</entity> <event>following</event> <entity>function</entity>, especially in <entity>cell biology</entity>, and this will become clear as we explore <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity> (Figure 4.8). Unlike <entity>prokaryotic cells</entity>, <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity> have: 1) a <entity>membrane</entity>-<entity>bound</entity> <entity>nucleus</entity>; 2) numerous <entity>membrane</entity>-<entity>bound</entity> <entity>organelles</entity> such as the <entity>endoplasmic reticulum</entity>, <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>, <entity>chloroplasts</entity>, <entity>mitochondria</entity>, and others; and 3) several, rod-shaped <entity>chromosomes</entity>. Because a <entity>membrane</entity> surrounds <entity>eukaryotic cell</entity>’s <entity>nucleus</entity>, it has a “<entity>true nucleus</entity>.” The word “<entity>organelle</entity>” means “little <entity>organ</entity>,” and, as we already mentioned, <entity>organelles</entity> have specialized <entity>cellular functions</entity>, just as your <entity>body</entity>'s <entity>organs</entity> have specialized <entity>functions</entity>.

At this point, it should be clear to you that <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity> have a more <entity>complex structure</entity> than <entity>prokaryotic cells</entity>. <entity>Organelles</entity> allow different <entity>functions</entity> to be compartmentalized in different areas of the <entity>cell</entity>. Before turning to <entity>organelles</entity>, let’s first examine <entity>two</entity> important components of the <entity>cell</entity>: the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> and the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>.

<entity>VISUAL</entity> CONNECTION
Part a: This illustration shows a typical <entity>eukaryotic animal cell</entity>, which is egg shaped. The fluid inside the <entity>cell</entity> is called the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>, and the <entity>cell</entity> is surrounded by a <entity>cell membrane</entity>. The <entity>nucleus</entity> takes up about one-half the width of the <entity>cell</entity>. Inside the <entity>nucleus</entity> is the <entity>chromatin</entity>, which is composed of <entity>DNA</entity> and <event>associated</event> <entity>proteins</entity>. A <entity>region</entity> of the <entity>chromatin</entity> is condensed into the <entity>nucleolus</entity>, a <entity>structure</entity> where <entity>ribosomes</entity> are synthesized. The <entity>nucleus</entity> is encased in a <entity>nuclear envelope</entity>, which is perforated by <entity>protein</entity>-<event>lined</event> <entity>pores</entity> that allow entry of material into the <entity>nucleus</entity>. The <entity>nucleus</entity> is surrounded by the <entity>rough</entity> and <entity>smooth endoplasmic reticulum</entity>, or ER. The <entity>smooth</entity> ER is the site of <event>lipid synthesis</event>. The <entity>rough</entity> ER has embedded <entity>ribosomes</entity> that give it a bumpy appearance. It synthesizes <entity>membrane</entity> and <entity>secretory proteins</entity>. In addition to the ER, many other <entity>organelles</entity> float inside the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. These include the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>, which modifies <entity>proteins</entity> and <entity>lipids</entity> synthesized in the ER. The <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity> is made of layers of <entity>flat membranes</entity>. <entity>Mitochondria</entity>, which produce food for the <entity>cell</entity>, have an <entity>outer membrane</entity> and a highly folded <entity>inner membrane</entity>. Other, smaller <entity>organelles</entity> include <entity>peroxisomes</entity> that metabolize waste, <entity>lysosomes</entity> that digest food, and <entity>vacuoles</entity>. <entity>Ribosomes</entity>, responsible for <event>protein synthesis</event>, also float freely in the <entity>cytoplasm</entity> and are depicted as <entity>small</entity> dots. The last <entity>cellular</entity> component shown is the <entity>cytoskeleton</entity>, which has four different types of components: <entity>microfilaments</entity>, <event>intermediate filaments</event>, <entity>microtubules</entity>, and <entity>centrosomes</entity>. <entity>Microfilaments</entity> are fibrous <entity>proteins</entity> that <event>line</event> the <entity>cell membrane</entity> and make up the <entity>cellular cortex</entity>. <event>Intermediate filaments</event> are fibrous <entity>proteins</entity> that hold <entity>organelles</entity> in place. <entity>Microtubules</entity> <entity>form</entity> the <entity>mitotic spindle</entity> and maintain <entity>cell</entity> shape. <entity>Centrosomes</entity> are made of <entity>two</entity> tubular <entity>structures</entity> at right angles to one another. They <entity>form</entity> the <entity>microtubule-organizing center</entity>.
Part b: This illustration depicts a typical <entity>eukaryotic plant cell</entity>. The <entity>nucleus</entity> of a <entity>plant cell</entity> contains <entity>chromatin</entity> and a <entity>nucleolus</entity>, the same as an <entity>animal cell</entity>. Other <entity>structures</entity> that the <entity>plant cell</entity> has in common with the <entity>animal cell</entity> include <entity>rough</entity> and <entity>smooth endoplasmic reticulum</entity>, the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>, <entity>mitochondria</entity>, <entity>peroxisomes</entity>, and <entity>ribosomes</entity>. The fluid inside the <entity>plant cell</entity> is called the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>, just as it is in an <entity>animal cell</entity>. The <entity>plant cell</entity> has three of the four <entity>cytoskeletal</entity> components found in <entity>animal cells</entity>: <entity>microtubules</entity>, <event>intermediate filaments</event>, and <entity>microfilaments</entity>. <entity>Plant cells</entity> do not have <entity>centrosomes</entity>. <entity>Plant cells</entity> have four <entity>structures</entity> not found in <entity>animals cells</entity>: <entity>chloroplasts</entity>, <entity>plastids</entity>, a <entity>central vacuole</entity>, and a <entity>cell</entity> wall. <entity>Chloroplasts</entity> are responsible for <event>photosynthesis</event>; they have an <entity>outer membrane</entity>, an <entity>inner membrane</entity>, and <entity>stack</entity> of <entity>membranes</entity> inside the <entity>inner membrane</entity>. The <entity>central vacuole</entity> is a very large, fluid-filled <entity>structure</entity> that maintains <entity>pressure</entity> against the <entity>cell</entity> wall. <entity>Plastids store pigments</entity>. The <entity>cell</entity> wall is outside the <entity>cell membrane</entity>.
Figure 4.8 These figures show the <entity>major organelles</entity> and other <entity>cell</entity> components of (a) a typical <entity>animal cell</entity> and (b) a typical <entity>eukaryotic plant cell</entity>. The <entity>plant cell</entity> has a <entity>cell</entity> wall, <entity>chloroplasts</entity>, <entity>plastids</entity>, and a <entity>central vacuole</entity>—structures not in <entity>animal cells</entity>. Most <entity>cells</entity> do not have <entity>lysosomes</entity> or <entity>centrosomes</entity>.
If the <entity>nucleolus</entity> were not able to <event>carry</event> out its <entity>function</entity>, what other <entity>cellular organelles</entity> would be affected?

The <entity>Plasma</entity> Membrane
Like <entity>prokaryotes</entity>, <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity> have a <entity>plasma membrane</entity> (Figure 4.9), a <entity>phospholipid bilayer</entity> with embedded <entity>proteins</entity> that separates the <entity>internal contents</entity> of the <entity>cell</entity> from its surrounding environment. A <entity>phospholipid</entity> is a <entity>lipid molecule</entity> with <entity>two fatty acid chains</entity> and a <entity>phosphate</entity>-containing <entity>group</entity>. The <entity>plasma membrane</entity> controls the passage of <entity>organic molecules</entity>, <entity>ions</entity>, water, and oxygen into and out of the <entity>cell</entity>. Wastes (such as carbon dioxide and ammonia) also leave the <entity>cell</entity> by passing through the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>.

The <entity>plasma membrane</entity> is composed of a <entity>phospholipid bilayer</entity>. In the <entity>bilayer</entity>, the <entity>two</entity> long <entity>hydrophobic</entity> tails of <entity>phospholipids</entity> <entity>face</entity> toward the <entity>center</entity>, and the <entity>hydrophilic head group</entity> <entity>faces</entity> the exterior. <entity>Integral membrane proteins</entity> and <entity>protein channels</entity> span the entire <entity>bilayer</entity>. <entity>Protein channels</entity> have a <entity>pore</entity> in the middle. <entity>Peripheral membrane proteins</entity> sit on the <entity>surface</entity> of the <entity>phospholipids</entity>, and are <event>associated</event> with the <entity>phospholipid head groups</entity>. On the exterior <entity>side</entity> of the <entity>membrane</entity>, <entity>carbohydrates</entity> are attached to certain <entity>proteins</entity> and <entity>lipids</entity>. <event>Filaments</event> of the <entity>cytoskeleton</entity> <event>line</event> the interior of the <entity>membrane</entity>.
Figure 4.9 The <entity>eukaryotic plasma membrane</entity> is a <entity>phospholipid bilayer</entity> with <entity>proteins</entity> and <entity>cholesterol</entity> embedded in it.
The <entity>plasma membranes</entity> of <entity>cells</entity> that specialize in <event>absorption</event> fold into fingerlike projections that we call <entity>microvilli</entity> (singular = <entity>microvillus</entity>); (Figure 4.10). Such <entity>cells</entity> typically <event>line</event> the <entity>small intestine</entity>, the <entity>organ</entity> that absorbs <entity>nutrients</entity> from digested food. This is an excellent example of <entity>form</entity> <event>following</event> <entity>function</entity>. People with <entity>celiac disease</entity> have an <entity>immune response</entity> to <entity>gluten</entity>, which is a <entity>protein</entity> in wheat, <entity>barley</entity>, and rye. The <entity>immune response</entity> damages <entity>microvilli</entity>, and thus, afflicted individuals cannot absorb <entity>nutrients</entity>. This leads to <event>malnutrition</event>, cramping, and diarrhea. Patients suffering from <entity>celiac disease</entity> must <event>follow</event> a <entity>gluten-free diet</entity>.

The left part of this figure is a <entity>transmission electron micrograph</entity> of <entity>microvilli</entity>, which appear as long, slender stalks extending from the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>. The right <entity>side</entity> illustrates <entity>cells</entity> containing <entity>microvilli</entity>. The <entity>microvilli</entity> cover the <entity>surface</entity> of the <entity>cell</entity> <entity>facing</entity> the interior of the <entity>small intestine</entity>.
Figure 4.10 <entity>Microvilli</entity>, as they appear on <entity>cells</entity> lining the <entity>small intestine</entity>, increase the <entity>surface</entity> area available for <event>absorption</event>. These <entity>microvilli</entity> are only on the area of the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> that <entity>faces</entity> the cavity from which substances will be absorbed. (<entity>credit</entity> "<entity>micrograph</entity>": <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by Louisa Howard)
The Cytoplasm
The <entity>cytoplasm</entity> is the <entity>cell</entity>'s entire <entity>region</entity> between the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> and the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity> (a <entity>structure</entity> we will discuss shortly). It is comprised of <entity>organelles</entity> suspended in the gel-like <entity>cytosol</entity>, the <entity>cytoskeleton</entity>, and various <entity>chemicals</entity> (Figure 4.8). Even though the <entity>cytoplasm</entity> consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the <entity>proteins</entity> within it. However, <entity>proteins</entity> are not the only <entity>organic molecules</entity> in the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. <entity>Glucose</entity> and other simple <entity>sugars</entity>, <entity>polysaccharides</entity>, <entity>amino acids</entity>, <entity>nucleic acids</entity>, <entity>fatty acids</entity>, and derivatives of glycerol are also there. <entity>Ions</entity> of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other <entity>elements</entity> also dissolve in the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. Many <entity>metabolic reactions</entity>, including <event>protein synthesis</event>, take place in the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>.

The Nucleus
Typically, the <entity>nucleus</entity> is the most prominent <entity>organelle</entity> in a <entity>cell</entity> (Figure 4.8). The <entity>nucleus</entity> (plural = nuclei) houses the <entity>cell</entity>’s <entity>DNA</entity> and directs the <event>synthesis</event> of <entity>ribosomes</entity> and <entity>proteins</entity>. Let’s look at it in more detail (Figure 4.11).

The <entity>two</entity>-dimensional image depicts the <entity>nucleus</entity> of a <entity>cell</entity> as a <entity>circular</entity> object with <entity>two membranes</entity>; several <entity>gaps</entity> appear in the circle, representing <entity>nuclear pores</entity>. Surrounding the <entity>nucleus</entity> are membranous sacks representing the <entity>endoplasmic reticulum</entity>. Inside the <entity>nucleus</entity> is another circle, approximately ten percent of the total size of the <entity>nucleus</entity>, representing the <entity>nucleolus</entity>.
Figure 4.11 The <entity>nucleus stores chromatin</entity> (<entity>DNA</entity> plus <entity>proteins</entity>) in a gel-like substance called the <entity>nucleoplasm</entity>. The <entity>nucleolus</entity> is a condensed <entity>chromatin region</entity> where <event>ribosome synthesis</event> occurs. We call the <entity>nucleus</entity>' <entity>boundary</entity> the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity>. It consists of <entity>two phospholipid bilayers</entity>: an <entity>outer</entity> and an <entity>inner membrane</entity>. The <entity>nuclear membrane</entity> is continuous with the <entity>endoplasmic reticulum</entity>. <entity>Nuclear pores</entity> allow substances to enter and exit the <entity>nucleus</entity>.
The <entity>Nuclear</entity> Envelope
The <entity>nuclear envelope</entity> is a <entity>double-membrane structure</entity> that constitutes the <entity>nucleus</entity>' outermost portion (Figure 4.11). Both the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity>'s <entity>inner</entity> and <entity>outer membranes</entity> are <entity>phospholipid bilayers</entity>.

The <entity>nuclear envelope</entity> is punctuated with <entity>pores</entity> that control the passage of <entity>ions</entity>, <entity>molecules</entity>, and <entity>RNA</entity> between the <entity>nucleoplasm</entity> and <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. The <entity>nucleoplasm</entity> is the semi-solid fluid inside the <entity>nucleus</entity>, where we find the <entity>chromatin</entity> and the <entity>nucleolus</entity>.

<entity>Chromatin</entity> and Chromosomes
To understand <entity>chromatin</entity>, it is helpful to first explore <entity>chromosomes</entity>, <entity>structures</entity> within the <entity>nucleus</entity> that are made up of <entity>DNA</entity>, the hereditary material. You may remember that in <entity>prokaryotes</entity>, <entity>DNA</entity> is organized into a <entity>single circular chromosome</entity>. In <entity>eukaryotes</entity>, <entity>chromosomes</entity> are <entity>linear structures</entity>. Every <entity>eukaryotic</entity> species has a specific <entity>number</entity> of <entity>chromosomes</entity> in the <entity>nucleus</entity> of each <entity>cell</entity>. For example, in <entity>humans</entity>, the <entity>chromosome number</entity> is 46, while in <entity>fruit</entity> flies, it is eight. <entity>Chromosomes</entity> are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the <entity>cell</entity> is getting ready to <event>divide</event>. When the <entity>cell</entity> is in the <entity>growth</entity> and maintenance phases of its <entity>life</entity> cycle, <entity>proteins</entity> attach to <entity>chromosomes</entity>, and they resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads. We call these unwound <entity>protein-chromosome complexes chromatin</entity> (Figure 4.12). <entity>Chromatin</entity> describes the material that makes up the <entity>chromosomes</entity> both when condensed and <entity>decondensed</entity>.

Part a: In this illustration, <entity>DNA</entity> tightly coiled into <entity>two</entity> thick cylinders is shown in the upper right. A close-up shows how the <entity>DNA</entity> is coiled around <entity>proteins</entity> called <entity>histones</entity>. Part b: This image shows <event>paired</event> <entity>chromosomes</entity>. The <entity>chromosomes</entity> are shown as a collection of slender <entity>tubes</entity>.
Figure 4.12 (a) This image shows various levels of <entity>chromatin</entity>'s organization (<entity>DNA</entity> and <entity>protein</entity>). (b) This image shows <event>paired</event> <entity>chromosomes</entity>. (<entity>credit</entity> b: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by NIH; <entity>scale-bar</entity> data from Matt Russell)
The Nucleolus
We already know that the <entity>nucleus</entity> directs the <event>synthesis</event> of <entity>ribosomes</entity>, but how does it do this? Some <entity>chromosomes</entity> have <entity>sections</entity> of <entity>DNA</entity> that encode <entity>ribosomal RNA</entity>. A darkly <entity>staining</entity> area within the <entity>nucleus</entity> called the <entity>nucleolus</entity> (plural = <entity>nucleoli</entity>) <entity>aggregates</entity> the <entity>ribosomal RNA</entity> with <event>associated</event> <entity>proteins</entity> to assemble the <entity>ribosomal subunits</entity> that are then <entity>transported</entity> out through the <entity>pores</entity> in the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity> to the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>.

Ribosomes
<entity>Ribosomes</entity> are the <entity>cellular structures</entity> responsible for <event>protein synthesis</event>. When we view them through an <entity>electron microscope</entity>, <entity>ribosomes</entity> appear either as clusters (<entity>polyribosomes</entity>) or <entity>single</entity>, tiny dots that float freely in the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. They may be attached to the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>'s <entity>cytoplasmic side</entity> or the <entity>endoplasmic reticulum</entity>'s <entity>cytoplasmic side</entity> and the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity>'s <entity>outer membrane</entity> (Figure 4.8). <entity>Electron microscopy</entity> shows us that <entity>ribosomes</entity>, which are large <entity>protein</entity> and <entity>RNA complexes</entity>, consist of <entity>two subunits</entity>, large and <entity>small</entity> (Figure 4.13). <entity>Ribosomes</entity> receive their “<entity>orders</entity>” for <event>protein synthesis</event> from the <entity>nucleus</entity> where the <entity>DNA</entity> transcribes into <entity>messenger RNA</entity> (<entity>mRNA</entity>). The <entity>mRNA</entity> travels to the <entity>ribosomes</entity>, which translate the code provided by the sequence of the <entity>nitrogenous bases</entity> in the <entity>mRNA</entity> into a specific <entity>order</entity> of <entity>amino acids</entity> in a <entity>protein</entity>. <entity>Amino acids</entity> are the building blocks of <entity>proteins</entity>.

The <entity>ribosome</entity> consists of a <entity>small subunit</entity> and a large <entity>subunit</entity>, which is about three times as big as the <entity>small</entity> one. The large <entity>subunit</entity> sits on top of the <entity>small</entity> one. A <entity>chain</entity> of m R N A threads between the large and <entity>small subunits</entity>. A <entity>protein chain</entity> extends from the top of the large <entity>subunit</entity>.
Figure 4.13 A large <entity>subunit</entity> (top) and a <entity>small subunit</entity> (bottom) comprise <entity>ribosomes</entity>. During <event>protein synthesis</event>, <entity>ribosomes</entity> assemble <entity>amino acids</entity> into <entity>proteins</entity>.
Because <event>protein synthesis</event> is an essential <entity>function</entity> of all <entity>cells</entity> (including <entity>enzymes</entity>, <entity>hormones</entity>, antibodies, <entity>pigments</entity>, <entity>structural</entity> components, and <entity>surface receptors</entity>), there are <entity>ribosomes</entity> in practically every <entity>cell</entity>. <entity>Ribosomes</entity> are particularly abundant in <entity>cells</entity> that synthesize large amounts of <entity>protein</entity>. For example, the pancreas is responsible for creating several <entity>digestive enzymes</entity> and the <entity>cells</entity> that produce these <entity>enzymes</entity> contain many <entity>ribosomes</entity>. Thus, we see another example of <entity>form</entity> <event>following</event> <entity>function</entity>.

Mitochondria
Scientists often call <entity>mitochondria</entity> (singular = <entity>mitochondrion</entity>) the <entity>cell</entity>'s “<entity>powerhouses</entity>” or “<entity>energy</entity> factories” because they are responsible for making adenosine <entity>triphosphate</entity> (<entity>ATP</entity>), the <entity>cell</entity>’s main <entity>energy-carrying molecule</entity>. <entity>ATP</entity> represents the <entity>cell</entity>'s short-term <event>stored</event> <entity>energy</entity>. <event>Cellular respiration</event> is the process of making <entity>ATP</entity> using the <entity>chemical energy</entity> in <entity>glucose</entity> and other <entity>nutrients</entity>. In <entity>mitochondria</entity>, this process uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide as a waste product. In fact, the carbon dioxide that you exhale with every breath comes from the <entity>cellular reactions</entity> that produce carbon dioxide as a <entity>byproduct</entity>.

In keeping with our theme of <entity>form</entity> <event>following</event> <entity>function</entity>, it is important to point out that <entity>muscle cells</entity> have a very high <event>concentration</event> of <entity>mitochondria</entity> that produce <entity>ATP</entity>. Your <entity>muscle cells</entity> need considerable <entity>energy</entity> to keep your <entity>body</entity> moving. When your <entity>cells</entity> don’t get enough oxygen, they do not make much <entity>ATP</entity>. Instead, producing <entity>lactic acid</entity> accompanies the <entity>small</entity> amount of <entity>ATP</entity> they make in the absence of oxygen.

<entity>Mitochondria</entity> are oval-shaped, <entity>double membrane organelles</entity> (Figure 4.14) that have their own <entity>ribosomes</entity> and <entity>DNA</entity>. Each <entity>membrane</entity> is a <entity>phospholipid bilayer</entity> embedded with <entity>proteins</entity>. The <entity>inner</entity> layer has folds called <entity>cristae</entity>. We call the area surrounded by the folds the <entity>mitochondrial matrix</entity>. The <entity>cristae</entity> and the <entity>matrix</entity> have different roles in <event>cellular respiration</event>.

This <entity>transmission electron micrograph</entity> of a <entity>mitochondrion</entity> shows an oval <entity>outer membrane</entity> and an <entity>inner membrane</entity> with many folds called <entity>cristae</entity>. Inside the <entity>inner membrane</entity> is a <entity>space</entity> called the <entity>mitochondrial matrix</entity>.
Figure 4.14 This <entity>electron micrograph</entity> shows a <entity>mitochondrion</entity> through an <entity>electron microscope</entity>. This <entity>organelle</entity> has an <entity>outer membrane</entity> and an <entity>inner membrane</entity>. The <entity>inner membrane</entity> contains folds, called <entity>cristae</entity>, which increase its <entity>surface</entity> area. We call the <entity>space</entity> between the <entity>two membranes</entity> the <entity>intermembrane space</entity>, and the <entity>space</entity> inside the <entity>inner membrane</entity> the <entity>mitochondrial matrix</entity>. <event>ATP synthesis</event> takes place on the <entity>inner membrane</entity>. (<entity>credit</entity>: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by Matthew Britton; <entity>scale-bar</entity> data from Matt Russell)
Peroxisomes
<entity>Peroxisomes</entity> are <entity>small</entity>, round <entity>organelles</entity> enclosed by <entity>single membranes</entity>. They <event>carry</event> out <entity>oxidation reactions</entity> that break down <entity>fatty acids</entity> and <entity>amino acids</entity>. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the <entity>body</entity>. (Many of these <entity>oxidation reactions</entity> release hydrogen <entity>peroxide</entity>, H2O2, which would be damaging to <entity>cells</entity>; however, when these <entity>reactions</entity> are confined to <entity>peroxisomes</entity>, <entity>enzymes</entity> safely break down the H2O2 into oxygen and water.) For example, <entity>peroxisomes</entity> in <entity>liver cells</entity> detoxify alcohol. Glyoxysomes, which are specialized <entity>peroxisomes</entity> in <entity>plants</entity>, are responsible for converting <event>stored</event> <entity>fats</entity> into <entity>sugars</entity>. <entity>Plant cells</entity> contain many different types of <entity>peroxisomes</entity> that play a role in metabolism, <entity>pathogene defense</entity>, and <entity>stress response</entity>, to mention a few.

<entity>Vesicles</entity> and Vacuoles
<entity>Vesicles</entity> and <entity>vacuoles</entity> are <entity>membrane</entity>-<entity>bound</entity> <entity>sacs</entity> that <entity>function</entity> in storage and <entity>transport</entity>. Other than the fact that <entity>vacuoles</entity> are somewhat larger than <entity>vesicles</entity>, there is a very subtle distinction between them. <entity>Vesicle membranes</entity> can <entity>fuse</entity> with either the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> or other <entity>membrane systems</entity> within the <entity>cell</entity>. Additionally, some agents such as <entity>enzymes</entity> within <entity>plant vacuoles</entity> break down <entity>macromolecules</entity>. The <entity>vacuole</entity>'s <entity>membrane</entity> does not <entity>fuse</entity> with the <entity>membranes</entity> of other <entity>cellular</entity> components.

<entity>Animal Cells</entity> versus <entity>Plant</entity> Cells
At this point, you know that each <entity>eukaryotic cell</entity> has a <entity>plasma membrane</entity>, <entity>cytoplasm</entity>, a <entity>nucleus</entity>, <entity>ribosomes</entity>, <entity>mitochondria</entity>, <entity>peroxisomes</entity>, and in some, <entity>vacuoles</entity>, but there are some striking differences between <entity>animal</entity> and <entity>plant cells</entity>. While both <entity>animal</entity> and <entity>plant cells</entity> have <entity>microtubule organizing centers</entity> (<entity>MTOCs</entity>), <entity>animal cells</entity> also have <entity>centrioles</entity> <event>associated</event> with the <entity>MTOC</entity>: a <entity>complex</entity> we call the <entity>centrosome</entity>. <entity>Animal cells</entity> each have a <entity>centrosome</entity> and <entity>lysosomes</entity>; whereas, most <entity>plant cells</entity> do not. <entity>Plant cells</entity> have a <entity>cell</entity> wall, <entity>chloroplasts</entity> and other specialized <entity>plastids</entity>, and a large <entity>central vacuole</entity>; whereas, <entity>animal cells</entity> do not.

The Centrosome
The <entity>centrosome</entity> is a <entity>microtubule-organizing center</entity> found near the nuclei of <entity>animal cells</entity>. It contains a <event>pair</event> of <entity>centrioles</entity>, <entity>two structures</entity> that lie perpendicular to each other (Figure 4.15). Each <entity>centriole</entity> is a cylinder of nine <entity>triplets</entity> of <entity>microtubules</entity>.

The image depicts <entity>two tube</entity>-like <entity>structures</entity>, one on top of the other, at right angles. Each of the <entity>tubes</entity> is labeled as the <entity>centriole</entity>. Each <entity>tube</entity> is composed of smaller <entity>tubes</entity> <entity>grouped</entity> in threes; these are labeled '<entity>microtubule triplet</entity>.' Each <entity>centriole tube</entity> is composed of nine <entity>triplets</entity> arranged to <entity>form</entity> the wall of the <entity>tube</entity>.
Figure 4.15 The <entity>centrosome</entity> consists of <entity>two centrioles</entity> that lie at right angles to each other. Each <entity>centriole</entity> is a cylinder comprised of nine <entity>triplets</entity> of <entity>microtubules</entity>. <entity>Nontubulin proteins</entity> (indicated by the green <event>lines</event>) hold the <entity>microtubule triplets</entity> together.
The <entity>centrosome</entity> (the <entity>organelle</entity> where all <entity>microtubules</entity> originate) replicates itself before a <entity>cell</entity> <event>divides</event>, and the <entity>centrioles</entity> appear to have some role in pulling the duplicated <entity>chromosomes</entity> to opposite ends of the <entity>dividing cell</entity>. However, the <entity>centriole</entity>'s <entity>exact function</entity> in <event>cell division</event> isn’t clear, because <entity>cells</entity> that have had the <entity>centrosome</entity> removed can still <event>divide</event>, and <entity>plant cells</entity>, which lack <entity>centrosomes</entity>, are capable of <event>cell division</event>.

Lysosomes
<entity>Animal cells</entity> have another set of <entity>organelles</entity> that most <entity>plant cells</entity> do not: <entity>lysosomes</entity>. The <entity>lysosomes</entity> are the <entity>cell</entity>’s “garbage disposal.” In <entity>plant cells</entity>, the <entity>digestive</entity> processes take place in <entity>vacuoles</entity>. <entity>Enzymes</entity> within the <entity>lysosomes</entity> aid in breaking down <entity>proteins</entity>, <entity>polysaccharides</entity>, <entity>lipids</entity>, <entity>nucleic acids</entity>, and even worn-out <entity>organelles</entity>. These <entity>enzymes</entity> are active at a much lower pH than the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>'s. Therefore, the pH within <entity>lysosomes</entity> is more <entity>acidic</entity> than the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>'s pH. Many <entity>reactions</entity> that take place in the <entity>cytoplasm</entity> could not occur at a low pH, so again, the advantage of compartmentalizing the <entity>eukaryotic cell</entity> into <entity>organelles</entity> is apparent.

The <entity>Cell</entity> Wall
If you examine Figure 4.8, the <entity>plant cell diagram</entity>, you will see a <entity>structure external</entity> to the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>. This is the <entity>cell</entity> wall, a rigid covering that protects the <entity>cell</entity>, provides <entity>structural</entity> support, and gives shape to the <entity>cell</entity>. <entity>Fungal</entity> and some <entity>protistan cells</entity> also have <entity>cell</entity> walls. While the <entity>prokaryotic cell</entity> walls' chief component is <entity>peptidoglycan</entity>, the <entity>major organic molecule</entity> in the <entity>plant</entity> (and some <entity>protists</entity>') <entity>cell</entity> wall is <entity>cellulose</entity> (Figure 4.16), a <entity>polysaccharide</entity> comprised of <entity>glucose units</entity>. Have you ever noticed that when you bite into a raw vegetable, like <entity>celery</entity>, it crunches? That’s because you are tearing the <entity>celery cells</entity>' rigid <entity>cell</entity> walls with your teeth.

This illustration shows three <entity>glucose subunits</entity> that are attached together. Dashed <event>lines</event> at each end indicate that many more <entity>subunits</entity> make up an entire <entity>cellulose fiber</entity>. Each <entity>glucose subunit</entity> is a closed ring composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen <entity>atoms</entity>.
Figure 4.16 <entity>Cellulose</entity> is a long <entity>chain</entity> of β-glucose <entity>molecules</entity> connected by a 1-4 <entity>linkage</entity>. The dashed <event>lines</event> at each end of the figure indicate a series of many more <entity>glucose units</entity>. The size of the page makes it impossible to portray an entire <entity>cellulose molecule</entity>.
Chloroplasts
Like the <entity>mitochondria</entity>, <entity>chloroplasts</entity> have their own <entity>DNA</entity> and <entity>ribosomes</entity>, but <entity>chloroplasts</entity> have an entirely different <entity>function</entity>. <entity>Chloroplasts</entity> are <entity>plant cell organelles</entity> that <event>carry</event> out <event>photosynthesis</event>. <event>Photosynthesis</event> is the series of <entity>reactions</entity> that use carbon dioxide, water, and <entity>light energy</entity> to make <entity>glucose</entity> and oxygen. This is a <entity>major</entity> difference between <entity>plants</entity> and <entity>animals</entity>. <entity>Plants</entity> (<entity>autotrophs</entity>) are able to make their own food, like <entity>sugars</entity>, while <entity>animals</entity> (<entity>heterotrophs</entity>) must ingest their food.

Like <entity>mitochondria</entity>, <entity>chloroplasts</entity> have <entity>outer</entity> and <entity>inner membranes</entity>, but within the <entity>space</entity> enclosed by a <entity>chloroplast</entity>’s <entity>inner membrane</entity> is a set of interconnected and <entity>stacked</entity> fluid-filled <entity>membrane sacs</entity> we call <entity>thylakoids</entity> (Figure 4.17). Each <entity>thylakoid stack</entity> is a <entity>granum</entity> (plural = <entity>grana</entity>). We call the fluid enclosed by the <entity>inner membrane</entity> that surrounds the <entity>grana</entity> the <entity>stroma</entity>.

This illustration shows a <entity>chloroplast</entity>, which has an <entity>outer membrane</entity> and an <entity>inner membrane</entity>. The <entity>space</entity> between the <entity>outer</entity> and <entity>inner membranes</entity> is called the <entity>intermembrane space</entity>. Inside the <entity>inner membrane</entity> are <entity>flat</entity>, pancake-like <entity>structures</entity> called <entity>thylakoids</entity>. The <entity>thylakoids</entity> <entity>form</entity> <entity>stacks</entity> called <entity>grana</entity>. The <entity>liquid</entity> inside the <entity>inner membrane</entity> is called the <entity>stroma</entity>, and the <entity>space</entity> inside the <entity>thylakoids</entity> is called the <entity>thylakoid space</entity>.
Figure 4.17 The <entity>chloroplast</entity> has an <entity>outer membrane</entity>, an <entity>inner membrane</entity>, and <entity>membrane</entity> <entity>structures</entity> - <entity>thylakoids</entity> that are <entity>stacked</entity> into <entity>grana</entity>. We call the <entity>space</entity> inside the <entity>thylakoid membranes</entity> the <entity>thylakoid space</entity>. The <entity>light</entity> harvesting <entity>reactions</entity> take place in the <entity>thylakoid membranes</entity>, and <event>sugar synthesis</event> takes place in the fluid inside the <entity>inner membrane</entity>, which we call the <entity>stroma</entity>. <entity>Chloroplasts</entity> also have their own genome, which is contained on a <entity>single circular chromosome</entity>.
The <entity>chloroplasts</entity> contain a green <entity>pigment</entity>, <entity>chlorophyll</entity>, which captures the <entity>light energy</entity> that drives the <entity>reactions</entity> of <event>photosynthesis</event>. Like <entity>plant cells</entity>, photosynthetic <entity>protists</entity> also have <entity>chloroplasts</entity>. Some <entity>bacteria</entity> perform <event>photosynthesis</event>, but their <entity>chlorophyll</entity> is not relegated to an <entity>organelle</entity>.

EVOLUTION CONNECTION
Endosymbiosis
We have mentioned that both <entity>mitochondria</entity> and <entity>chloroplasts</entity> contain <entity>DNA</entity> and <entity>ribosomes</entity>. Have you wondered why? Strong evidence points to <event>endosymbiosis</event> as the explanation.

Symbiosis is a relationship in which <entity>organisms</entity> from <entity>two</entity> separate species depend on each other for their survival. <event>Endosymbiosis</event> (<entity>endo</entity>- = “within”) is a mutually beneficial relationship in which one organism lives inside the other. <entity>Endosymbiotic</entity> relationships abound in nature. We have already mentioned that <entity>microbes</entity> that produce <entity>vitamin</entity> K live inside the <entity>human</entity> gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize <entity>vitamin</entity> K. It is also beneficial for the <entity>microbes</entity> because they are protected from other <entity>organisms</entity> and from drying out, and they receive abundant food from the environment of the large <entity>intestine</entity>.

Scientists have long noticed that <entity>bacteria</entity>, <entity>mitochondria</entity>, and <entity>chloroplasts</entity> are similar in size. We also know that <entity>bacteria</entity> have <entity>DNA</entity> and <entity>ribosomes</entity>, just like <entity>mitochondria</entity> and <entity>chloroplasts</entity>. Scientists believe that <entity>host cells</entity> and <entity>bacteria</entity> <entity>formed</entity> an <entity>endosymbiotic</entity> relationship when the <entity>host cells</entity> ingested both <entity>aerobic</entity> and <entity>autotrophic bacteria</entity> (<entity>cyanobacteria</entity>) but did not destroy them. Through many millions of years of evolution, these ingested <entity>bacteria</entity> became more specialized in their <entity>functions</entity>, with the <entity>aerobic bacteria</entity> becoming <entity>mitochondria</entity> and the <entity>autotrophic bacteria</entity> becoming <entity>chloroplasts</entity>.

The <entity>Central</entity> Vacuole
Previously, we mentioned <entity>vacuoles</entity> as essential components of <entity>plant cells</entity>. If you look at Figure 4.8b, you will see that <entity>plant cells</entity> each have a large <entity>central vacuole</entity> that occupies most of the <entity>cell</entity>'s area. The <entity>central vacuole</entity> plays a key role in regulating the <entity>cell</entity>’s <event>concentration</event> of water in <entity>changing</entity> environmental conditions. Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a <entity>plant</entity> for a few days, it wilts? That’s because as the water <event>concentration</event> in the soil becomes lower than the water <event>concentration</event> in the <entity>plant</entity>, water moves out of the <entity>central vacuoles</entity> and <entity>cytoplasm</entity>. As the <entity>central vacuole</entity> shrinks, it leaves the <entity>cell</entity> wall unsupported. This loss of support to the <entity>plant</entity>'s <entity>cell</entity> walls results in the wilted appearance.

The <entity>central vacuole</entity> also supports the <entity>cell</entity>'s expansion. When the <entity>central vacuole</entity> holds more water, the <entity>cell</entity> becomes larger without having to invest considerable <entity>energy</entity> in synthesizing new <entity>cytoplasm</entity>.

By the end of this <entity>section</entity>, you will be able to do the <event>following</event>:
List the components of the <entity>endomembrane</entity> system
Recognize the relationship between the <entity>endomembrane system</entity> and its functions
The <entity>endomembrane system</entity> (<entity>endo</entity> = “within”) is a <entity>group</entity> of <entity>membranes</entity> and <entity>organelles</entity> (Figure 4.18) in <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity> that <entity>works</entity> together to modify, package, and <entity>transport lipids</entity> and <entity>proteins</entity>. It includes the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity>, <entity>lysosomes</entity>, and <entity>vesicles</entity>, which we have already mentioned, and the <entity>endoplasmic reticulum</entity> and <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>, which we will cover shortly. Although not technically within the <entity>cell</entity>, the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> is included in the <entity>endomembrane system</entity> because, as you will see, it interacts with the other <entity>endomembranous organelles</entity>. The <entity>endomembrane system</entity> does not include either <entity>mitochondria</entity> or <entity>chloroplast membranes</entity>.

<entity>VISUAL</entity> CONNECTION
The left part of this figure shows the <entity>rough</entity> E R with an <entity>integral membrane protein</entity> embedded in it. The part of the <entity>protein</entity> <entity>facing</entity> the inside of the E R has a <entity>carbohydrate</entity> attached to it. The <entity>protein</entity> is shown leaving the E R in a <entity>vesicle</entity> that <entity>fuses</entity> with the cis <entity>side</entity> of the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>. The <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity> consists of several layers of <entity>membranes</entity>, called <entity>cisternae</entity>. As the <entity>protein</entity> passes through the <entity>cisternae</entity>, it is further modified by the addition of more <entity>carbohydrates</entity>. Eventually, it leaves the <entity>trans face</entity> of the <entity>Golgi</entity> in a <entity>vesicle</entity>. The <entity>vesicle fuses</entity> with the <entity>cell membrane</entity> so that the <entity>carbohydrate</entity> that was on the inside of the <entity>vesicle</entity> now <entity>faces</entity> the outside of the <entity>membrane</entity>. At the same time, the <entity>contents</entity> of the <entity>vesicle</entity> are ejected from the <entity>cell</entity>.
Figure 4.18 <entity>Membrane</entity> and <entity>secretory proteins</entity> are synthesized in the <entity>rough endoplasmic reticulum</entity> (<entity>RER</entity>). The <entity>RER</entity> also sometimes modifies <entity>proteins</entity>. In this illustration, an attachment of a (purple) <entity>carbohydrate</entity> modifies a (green) <entity>integral membrane protein</entity> in the ER. <entity>Vesicles</entity> with the <entity>integral protein bud</entity> from the ER and <entity>fuse</entity> with the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>' cis <entity>face</entity>. As the <entity>protein</entity> passes along the <entity>Golgi</entity>’s <entity>cisternae</entity>, the addition of more <entity>carbohydrates</entity> further modifies it. After its <event>synthesis</event> is complete, it exits as an <entity>integral membrane protein</entity> of the <entity>vesicle</entity> that <entity>buds</entity> from the <entity>Golgi</entity>’s <entity>trans face</entity>. When the <entity>vesicle</entity> <entity>fuses</entity> with the <entity>cell membrane</entity>, the <entity>protein</entity> becomes an <entity>integral</entity> portion of that <entity>cell membrane</entity>. (<entity>credit</entity>: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by <entity>Magnus</entity> Manske)
If a <entity>peripheral membrane protein</entity> were synthesized in the <entity>lumen</entity> (inside) of the ER, would it end up on the inside or outside of the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>?

The <entity>Endoplasmic</entity> Reticulum
The <entity>endoplasmic reticulum</entity> (ER) (Figure 4.18) is a series of interconnected membranous <entity>sacs</entity> and <entity>tubules</entity> that collectively modifies <entity>proteins</entity> and synthesizes <entity>lipids</entity>. However, these <entity>two functions</entity> take place in separate areas of the ER: the <entity>rough</entity> ER and the <entity>smooth</entity> ER, respectively.

We call the ER <entity>tubules</entity>' <entity>hollow</entity> portion the <entity>lumen</entity> or <entity>cisternal space</entity>. The ER's <entity>membrane</entity>, which is a <entity>phospholipid bilayer</entity> embedded with <entity>proteins</entity>, is continuous with the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity>.

<entity>Rough</entity> ER
Scientists have named the <entity>rough endoplasmic reticulum</entity> (<entity>RER</entity>) as such because the <entity>ribosomes</entity> attached to its <entity>cytoplasmic surface</entity> give it a studded appearance when viewing it through an <entity>electron microscope</entity> (Figure 4.19).

In this <entity>transmission electron micrograph</entity>, the <entity>nucleus</entity> is the most prominent feature. The <entity>nucleolus</entity> is a <entity>circular</entity>, dark <entity>region</entity> inside the <entity>nucleus</entity>. A <entity>nuclear pore</entity> can be seen in the <entity>nuclear envelope</entity> that surrounds the <entity>nucleus</entity>. The <entity>rough endoplasmic reticulum</entity> surrounds the <entity>nucleus</entity>, appearing as many layers of <entity>membranes</entity>. A <entity>mitochondrion</entity> sits between the layers of the E R <entity>membrane</entity>.
Figure 4.19 This <entity>transmission electron micrograph</entity> shows the <entity>rough endoplasmic reticulum</entity> and other <entity>organelles</entity> in a <entity>pancreatic cell</entity>. (<entity>credit</entity>: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by Louisa Howard)
<entity>Ribosomes</entity> transfer their newly synthesized <entity>proteins</entity> into the <entity>RER</entity>'s <entity>lumen</entity> where they undergo <event>structural modifications</event>, such as folding or acquiring <entity>side chains</entity>. These modified <entity>proteins</entity> incorporate into <entity>cellular membranes—</entity>the ER or the ER's or other <entity>organelles</entity>' <entity>membranes</entity>. The <entity>proteins</entity> can also secrete from the <entity>cell</entity> (such as <entity>protein hormones</entity>, <entity>enzymes</entity>). The <entity>RER</entity> also makes <entity>phospholipids</entity> for <entity>cellular membranes</entity>.

If the <entity>phospholipids</entity> or modified <entity>proteins</entity> are not destined to stay in the <entity>RER</entity>, they will reach their destinations via <entity>transport vesicles</entity> that <entity>bud</entity> from the <entity>RER</entity>’s <entity>membrane</entity> (Figure 4.18).

Since the <entity>RER</entity> is engaged in modifying <entity>proteins</entity> (such as <entity>enzymes</entity>, for example) that secrete from the <entity>cell</entity>, you would be correct in assuming that the <entity>RER</entity> is abundant in <entity>cells</entity> that secrete <entity>proteins</entity>. This is the case with <entity>liver cells</entity>, for example.

<entity>Smooth</entity> ER
The <entity>smooth endoplasmic reticulum</entity> (<entity>SER</entity>) is continuous with the <entity>RER</entity> but has few or no <entity>ribosomes</entity> on its <entity>cytoplasmic surface</entity> (Figure 4.18). <entity>SER functions</entity> include <event>synthesis</event> of <entity>carbohydrates</entity>, <entity>lipids</entity>, and <entity>steroid hormones</entity>; <event>detoxification</event> of medications and poisons; and <event>storing</event> calcium <entity>ions</entity>.

In <entity>muscle cells</entity>, a specialized <entity>SER</entity>, the <entity>sarcoplasmic reticulum</entity>, is responsible for <event>storing</event> calcium <entity>ions</entity> that are needed to trigger the <entity>muscle cells</entity>' coordinated contractions.

You can watch an excellent animation of the <entity>endomembrane system</entity> here. At the end of the animation, there is a short self-assessment.

<entity>CAREER</entity> CONNECTION
Cardiologist
<entity>Heart disease</entity> is the leading <event>cause</event> of death in the United States. This is primarily due to our sedentary lifestyle and our high <entity>trans-fat diets</entity>.

<entity>Heart</entity> failure is just one of many disabling <entity>heart</entity> conditions. <entity>Heart</entity> failure does not mean that the <entity>heart</entity> has stopped <entity>working</entity>. Rather, it means that the <entity>heart</entity> can’t pump with sufficient <entity>force</entity> to <entity>transport</entity> oxygenated <entity>blood</entity> to all the <entity>vital organs</entity>. Left untreated, <entity>heart</entity> failure can lead to <entity>kidney</entity> failure and other <entity>organ</entity> failure.

<entity>Cardiac muscle tissue</entity> comprises the <entity>heart</entity>'s wall. <entity>Heart</entity> failure occurs when <entity>cardiac muscle</entity> <entity>cells</entity>' <entity>endoplasmic reticula</entity> do not <entity>function</entity> properly. As a result, an insufficient <entity>number</entity> of calcium <entity>ions</entity> are available to trigger a sufficient <entity>contractile force</entity>.

Cardiologists (cardi- = “<entity>heart</entity>”; -ologist = “one who <entity>studies</entity>”) are doctors who specialize in treating <entity>heart diseases</entity>, including <entity>heart</entity> failure. Cardiologists can diagnose <entity>heart</entity> failure via a physical <entity>examination</entity>, results from an electrocardiogram (<entity>ECG</entity>, a <entity>test</entity> that measures the <entity>heart</entity>'s <entity>electrical activity</entity>), a chest X-ray to see whether the <entity>heart</entity> is enlarged, and other <entity>tests</entity>. If the cardiologist diagnoses <entity>heart</entity> failure, he or she will typically prescribe appropriate medications and recommend a reduced table salt <entity>intake</entity> and a supervised exercise program.

The <entity>Golgi</entity> Apparatus
We have already mentioned that <entity>vesicles</entity> can <entity>bud</entity> from the ER and <entity>transport</entity> their <entity>contents</entity> elsewhere, but where do the <entity>vesicles</entity> go? Before reaching their final destination, the <entity>lipids</entity> or <entity>proteins</entity> within the <entity>transport vesicles</entity> still need sorting, packaging, and tagging so that they end up in the right place. Sorting, tagging, packaging, and distributing <entity>lipids</entity> and <entity>proteins</entity> takes place in the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity> (also called the <entity>Golgi body</entity>), a series of flattened <entity>membranes</entity> (Figure 4.20).

In this <entity>transmission electron micrograph</entity>, the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity> appears as a <entity>stack</entity> of <entity>membranes</entity> surrounded by unnamed <entity>organelles</entity>.
Figure 4.20 The <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity> in this <entity>white blood cell</entity> is visible as a <entity>stack</entity> of semicircular, flattened rings in the lower portion of the image. You can see several <entity>vesicles</entity> near the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>. (<entity>credit</entity>: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by Louisa Howard)
We call the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>' the cis <entity>face</entity>. The opposite <entity>side</entity> is the <entity>trans face</entity>. The <entity>transport vesicles</entity> that <entity>formed</entity> from the ER travel to the cis <entity>face</entity>, <entity>fuse</entity> with it, and empty their <entity>contents</entity> into the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>' <entity>lumen</entity>. As the <entity>proteins</entity> and <entity>lipids</entity> travel through the <entity>Golgi</entity>, they undergo further <event>modifications</event> that allow them to be sorted. The most frequent <event>modification</event> is adding short <entity>sugar molecule chains</entity>. These newly modified <entity>proteins</entity> and <entity>lipids</entity> then tag with <entity>phosphate groups</entity> or other <entity>small molecules</entity> in <entity>order</entity> to travel to their proper destinations.

Finally, the modified and tagged <entity>proteins</entity> are packaged into <entity>secretory vesicles</entity> that <entity>bud</entity> from the <entity>Golgi</entity>'s <entity>trans face</entity>. While some of these <entity>vesicles</entity> deposit their <entity>contents</entity> into other <entity>cell</entity> parts where they will be used, other <entity>secretory vesicles</entity> <entity>fuse</entity> with the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> and release their <entity>contents</entity> outside the <entity>cell</entity>.

In another example of <entity>form</entity> <event>following</event> <entity>function</entity>, <entity>cells</entity> that engage in a great deal of <entity>secretory activity</entity> (such as <entity>salivary gland cells</entity> that secrete <entity>digestive enzymes</entity> or <entity>immune system cells</entity> that secrete antibodies) have an abundance of <entity>Golgi</entity>.

In <entity>plant cells</entity>, the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity> has the additional role of synthesizing <entity>polysaccharides</entity>, some of which are incorporated into the <entity>cell</entity> wall and some of which other <entity>cell</entity> parts use.

<entity>CAREER</entity> CONNECTION
Geneticist
Many <entity>diseases</entity> arise from <event>genetic mutations</event> that prevent synthesizing <entity>critical proteins</entity>. One such <entity>disease</entity> is <entity>Lowe disease</entity> (or <entity>oculocerebrorenal syndrome</entity>, because it affects the eyes, brain, and <entity>kidneys</entity>). In <entity>Lowe disease</entity>, there is a deficiency in an <entity>enzyme</entity> localized to the <entity>Golgi apparatus</entity>. Children with <entity>Lowe disease</entity> are born with <entity>cataracts</entity>, typically develop <entity>kidney disease</entity> after the first year of <entity>life</entity>, and may have impaired mental abilities.

A <event>mutation</event> on the X <entity>chromosome</entity> <event>causes</event> <entity>Lowe disease</entity>. The X <entity>chromosome</entity> is one of the <entity>two human sex chromosomes</entity>, as these <entity>chromosomes</entity> determine a person's <entity>sex</entity>. Females possess <entity>two</entity> X <entity>chromosomes</entity> while males possess one X and one Y <entity>chromosome</entity>. In females, the <entity>genes</entity> on only one of the <entity>two</entity> X <entity>chromosomes</entity> are expressed. Females who <event>carry</event> the <entity>Lowe disease</entity> <entity>gene</entity> on one of their X <entity>chromosomes</entity> are carriers and do not show <entity>symptoms</entity> of the <entity>disease</entity>. However, males only have one X <entity>chromosome</entity> and the <entity>genes</entity> on this <entity>chromosome</entity> are always expressed. Therefore, males will always have <entity>Lowe disease</entity> if their X <entity>chromosome</entity> <event>carries</event> the <entity>Lowe disease</entity> <entity>gene</entity>. Geneticists have identified the <event>mutated</event> <entity>gene</entity>'s location, as well as many other <event>mutation</event> locations that <event>cause</event> <entity>genetic diseases</entity>. Through <entity>prenatal</entity> testing, a woman can find out if the <entity>fetus</entity> she is <event>carrying</event> may be afflicted with one of several <entity>genetic diseases</entity>.

Geneticists analyze <entity>prenatal genetic test</entity> results and may counsel pregnant women on available options. They may also conduct <entity>genetic</entity> research that leads to new drugs or foods, or perform <entity>DNA</entity> analyses for forensic investigations.

Lysosomes
In addition to their role as the <entity>digestive</entity> component and <entity>organelle</entity>-recycling facility of <entity>animal cells</entity>, <entity>lysosomes</entity> are part of the <entity>endomembrane system</entity>. <entity>Lysosomes</entity> also use their <entity>hydrolytic enzymes</entity> to destroy <entity>pathogens</entity> (<entity>disease</entity>-<event>causing</event> <entity>organisms</entity>) that might enter the <entity>cell</entity>. A good example of this occurs in <entity>macrophages</entity>, a <entity>group</entity> of <entity>white blood cells</entity> which are part of your <entity>body</entity>’s <entity>immune system</entity>. In a process that scientists call <event>phagocytosis</event> or <event>endocytosis</event>, a <entity>section</entity> of the <entity>macrophage</entity>'s <entity>plasma membrane</entity> invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a <entity>pathogen</entity>. The invaginated <entity>section</entity>, with the <entity>pathogen</entity> inside, then pinches itself <entity>off</entity> from the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> and becomes a <entity>vesicle</entity>. The <entity>vesicle fuses</entity> with a <entity>lysosome</entity>. The <entity>lysosome</entity>’s <entity>hydrolytic enzymes</entity> then destroy the <entity>pathogen</entity> (Figure 4.21).

In this illustration, a <entity>eukaryotic cell</entity> is shown consuming a bacterium. As the bacterium is consumed, it is encapsulated in a <entity>vesicle</entity>. The <entity>vesicle fuses</entity> with a <entity>lysosome</entity>, and <entity>proteins</entity> inside the <entity>lysosome</entity> digest the bacterium.
Figure 4.21 A <entity>macrophage</entity> has engulfed (phagocytized) a potentially pathogenic bacterium and then <entity>fuses</entity> with <entity>lysosomes</entity> within the <entity>cell</entity> to destroy the <entity>pathogen</entity>. Other <entity>organelles</entity> are present in the <entity>cell</entity> but for simplicity we do not show them.

By the end of this <entity>section</entity>, you will be able to do the <event>following</event>:
Describe the cytoskeleton
Compare the roles of <entity>microfilaments</entity>, <event>intermediate filaments</event>, and microtubules
Compare and <entity>contrast</entity> <entity>cilia</entity> and flagella
Summarize the differences among the components of <entity>prokaryotic cells</entity>, <entity>animal cells</entity>, and <entity>plant</entity> cells
If you were to remove all the <entity>organelles</entity> from a <entity>cell</entity>, would the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> and the <entity>cytoplasm</entity> be the only components left? No. Within the <entity>cytoplasm</entity>, there would still be <entity>ions</entity> and <entity>organic molecules</entity>, plus a network of <entity>protein fibers</entity> that help maintain the <entity>cell</entity>'s shape, secure some <entity>organelles</entity> in specific <entity>positions</entity>, allow <entity>cytoplasm</entity> and <entity>vesicles</entity> to move within the <entity>cell</entity>, and enable <entity>cells</entity> within multicellular <entity>organisms</entity> to move. Collectively, scientists call this network of <entity>protein fibers</entity> the <entity>cytoskeleton</entity>. There are three types of <entity>fibers</entity> within the <entity>cytoskeleton</entity>: <entity>microfilaments</entity>, <event>intermediate filaments</event>, and <entity>microtubules</entity> (Figure 4.22). Here, we will examine each.

<entity>Microfilaments</entity> <event>line</event> the inside of the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>, whereas <entity>microtubules</entity> radiate out from the <entity>center</entity> of the <entity>cell</entity>. <event>Intermediate filaments</event> <entity>form</entity> a network throughout the <entity>cell</entity> that holds <entity>organelles</entity> in place.
Figure 4.22 <entity>Microfilaments</entity> thicken the <entity>cortex</entity> around the <entity>cell</entity>'s <entity>inner</entity> edge. Like rubber bands, they resist <event>tension</event>. There are <entity>microtubules</entity> in the <entity>cell</entity>'s interior where they maintain their shape by resisting <entity>compressive forces</entity>. There are <event>intermediate filaments</event> throughout the <entity>cell</entity> that hold <entity>organelles</entity> in place.
Microfilaments
Of the three types of <entity>protein fibers</entity> in the <entity>cytoskeleton</entity>, <entity>microfilaments</entity> are the narrowest. They <entity>function</entity> in <event>cellular movement</event>, have a diameter of about 7 nm, and are comprised of <entity>two globular protein</entity> intertwined <entity>strands</entity>, which we call <entity>actin</entity> (Figure 4.23). For this reason, we also call <event>microfilaments actin filaments</event>.

This illustration shows <event>two actin filaments</event> wound together. Each <event>actin filament</event> is composed of many <entity>actin subunits</entity> connected together to <entity>form</entity> a <entity>chain</entity>.
Figure 4.23 Two intertwined <entity>actin strands</entity> comprise <entity>microfilaments</entity>.
<entity>ATP</entity> <entity>powers</entity> <entity>actin</entity> to assemble its filamentous <entity>form</entity>, which serves as a track for the <event>movement</event> of a motor <entity>protein</entity> we call <entity>myosin</entity>. This enables <entity>actin</entity> to engage in <entity>cellular events</entity> requiring motion, such as <event>cell division</event> in <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity> and <event>cytoplasmic streaming</event>, which is the <entity>cell cytoplasm</entity>'s <event>circular movement</event> in <entity>plant cells</entity>. <entity>Actin</entity> and <entity>myosin</entity> are plentiful in <entity>muscle cells</entity>. When your <entity>actin</entity> and <event>myosin filaments</event> slide past each other, your <entity>muscles</entity> contract.

<entity>Microfilaments</entity> also provide some <entity>rigidity</entity> and shape to the <entity>cell</entity>. They can <entity>depolymerize</entity> (<event>disassemble</event>) and reform quickly, thus enabling a <entity>cell</entity> to <entity>change</entity> its shape and move. <entity>White blood cells</entity> (your <entity>body</entity>’s <entity>infection</entity>-<event>fighting</event> <entity>cells</entity>) make good use of this ability. They can move to an <entity>infection</entity> site and phagocytize the <entity>pathogen</entity>.

<entity>Intermediate</entity> Filaments
Several <entity>strands</entity> of fibrous <entity>proteins</entity> that are wound together comprise <event>intermediate filaments</event> (Figure 4.24). <entity>Cytoskeleton elements</entity> get their name from the fact that their diameter, 8 to 10 nm, is between those of <entity>microfilaments</entity> and <entity>microtubules</entity>.

This illustration shows 10 <entity>intermediate filament fibers</entity> bundled together.
Figure 4.24 <event>Intermediate filaments</event> consist of several intertwined <entity>strands</entity> of fibrous <entity>proteins</entity>.
<event>Intermediate filaments</event> have no role in <event>cell movement</event>. Their <entity>function</entity> is purely <entity>structural</entity>. They bear <event>tension</event>, thus maintaining the <entity>cell</entity>'s shape, and <entity>anchor</entity> the <entity>nucleus</entity> and other <entity>organelles</entity> in place. Figure 4.22 shows how <event>intermediate filaments</event> create a supportive scaffolding inside the <entity>cell</entity>.

The <event>intermediate filaments</event> are the most diverse <entity>group</entity> of <entity>cytoskeletal elements</entity>. Several fibrous <entity>protein</entity> types are in the <event>intermediate filaments</event>. You are probably most familiar with <entity>keratin</entity>, the fibrous <entity>protein</entity> that strengthens your hair, nails, and the skin's <entity>epidermis</entity>.

Microtubules
As their name implies, <entity>microtubules</entity> are <entity>small hollow tubes</entity>. Polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin, <entity>two globular proteins</entity>, comprise the <entity>microtubule</entity>'s walls (Figure 4.25). With a diameter of about 25 nm, <entity>microtubules</entity> are <entity>cytoskeletons</entity>' widest components. They help the <entity>cell</entity> resist compression, provide a track along which <entity>vesicles</entity> move through the <entity>cell</entity>, and pull replicated <entity>chromosomes</entity> to opposite ends of a <entity>dividing cell</entity>. Like <entity>microfilaments</entity>, <entity>microtubules</entity> can <event>disassemble</event> and reform quickly.

The left part of this figure is a <entity>molecular model</entity> of 13 polymerized dimers of alpha- and beta-tubulin joined together to <entity>form</entity> a <entity>hollow tube</entity>. The right part of this image shows the <entity>tubulin structure</entity> as a ring of spheres connected together.
Figure 4.25 <entity>Microtubules</entity> are <entity>hollow</entity>. Their walls consist of 13 polymerized dimers of α-tubulin and β-tubulin (right image). The left image shows the <entity>tube</entity>'s <entity>molecular structure</entity>.
<entity>Microtubules</entity> are also the <entity>structural elements</entity> of <entity>flagella</entity>, <entity>cilia</entity>, and <entity>centrioles</entity> (the latter are the <entity>centrosome</entity>'s <entity>two</entity> perpendicular <entity>bodies</entity>). In <entity>animal cells</entity>, the <entity>centrosome</entity> is the <entity>microtubule-organizing center</entity>. In <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity>, <entity>flagella</entity> and <entity>cilia</entity> are quite different structurally from their counterparts in <entity>prokaryotes</entity>, as we discuss below.

<entity>Flagella</entity> and Cilia
The <entity>flagella</entity> (singular = <entity>flagellum</entity>) are long, hair-like <entity>structures</entity> that extend from the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> and enable an entire <entity>cell</entity> to move (for example, sperm, Euglena, and some <entity>prokaryotes</entity>). When present, the <entity>cell</entity> has just one <entity>flagellum</entity> or a few <entity>flagella</entity>. However, when <entity>cilia</entity> (singular = <entity>cilium</entity>) are present, many of them extend along the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>'s entire <entity>surface</entity>. They are short, hair-like <entity>structures</entity> that move entire <entity>cells</entity> (such as <entity>paramecia</entity>) or substances along the <entity>cell</entity>'s <entity>outer surface</entity> (for example, the <entity>cilia</entity> of <entity>cells</entity> lining the Fallopian <entity>tubes</entity> that move the <entity>ovum</entity> toward the <entity>uterus</entity>, or <entity>cilia</entity> lining the <entity>cells</entity> of the respiratory tract that trap <entity>particulate matter</entity> and move it toward your nostrils.)

Despite their differences in <entity>length</entity> and <entity>number</entity>, <entity>flagella</entity> and <entity>cilia</entity> share a common <entity>structural</entity> arrangement of <entity>microtubules</entity> called a “9 + 2 array.” This is an appropriate name because a <entity>single flagellum</entity> or <entity>cilium</entity> is made of a ring of nine <entity>microtubule doublets</entity>, surrounding a <entity>single microtubule doublet</entity> in the <entity>center</entity> (Figure 4.26).

This <entity>transmission electron micrograph</entity> shows a cross <entity>section</entity> of nine <entity>microtubule doublets</entity> that <entity>form</entity> a <entity>hollow tube</entity>. Another <entity>microtubule doublet</entity> sits in the <entity>center</entity> of the <entity>tube</entity>.
Figure 4.26 This <entity>transmission electron micrograph</entity> of <entity>two flagella</entity> shows the <entity>microtubules</entity>' 9 + 2 array: nine <entity>microtubule doublets</entity> surround a <entity>single microtubule doublet</entity>.

You have now completed a broad survey of <entity>prokaryotic</entity> and <entity>eukaryotic cell</entity> components. For a summary of <entity>cellular</entity> components in <entity>prokaryotic</entity> and <entity>eukaryotic cells</entity>, see Table 4.1.

By the end of this <entity>section</entity>, you will be able to do the <event>following</event>:

You already know that <entity>tissue</entity> is a <entity>group</entity> of similar <entity>cells</entity> <entity>working</entity> together. As you might expect, if <entity>cells</entity> are to <entity>work</entity> together, they must communicate with each other, just as you need to communicate with others if you <entity>work</entity> on a <entity>group project</entity>. Let’s take a look at how <entity>cells</entity> communicate with each other.

<entity>Extracellular Matrix</entity> of <entity>Animal</entity> Cells
While <entity>cells</entity> in most multicellular <entity>organisms</entity> release materials into the <entity>extracellular space</entity>, <entity>animal cells</entity> will be discussed as an example. The primary components of these materials are <entity>proteins</entity>, and the most abundant <entity>protein</entity> is <entity>collagen</entity>. <entity>Collagen fibers</entity> are interwoven with <entity>proteoglycans</entity>, which are <entity>carbohydrate</entity>-containing <entity>protein molecules</entity>. Collectively, we call these materials the <entity>extracellular matrix</entity> (Figure 4.27). Not only does the <entity>extracellular matrix</entity> hold the <entity>cells</entity> together to <entity>form</entity> a <entity>tissue</entity>, but it also allows the <entity>cells</entity> within the <entity>tissue</entity> to communicate with each other. How can this happen?

This illustration shows the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>. Embedded in the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> are <entity>integral membrane proteins</entity> called <entity>integrins</entity>. On the exterior of the <entity>cell</entity> is a vast network of <entity>collagen fibers</entity>. The <entity>fibers</entity> are attached to the <entity>integrins</entity> via a <entity>protein</entity> called <entity>fibronectin</entity>. <entity>Proteoglycan complexes</entity> also extend from the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> to the <entity>extracellular matrix</entity>. A close-up view shows that each <entity>proteoglycan complex</entity> is composed of a <entity>polysaccharide core</entity>. <entity>Proteins</entity> branch from this <entity>core</entity>, and <entity>carbohydrates</entity> branch from the <entity>proteins</entity>. The inside of the <entity>cytoplasmic membrane</entity> is <event>lined</event> with <entity>microfilaments</entity> of the <entity>cytoskeleton</entity>.
Figure 4.27 The <entity>extracellular matrix</entity> consists of a network of <entity>proteins</entity> and <entity>carbohydrates</entity>.
<entity>Cells</entity> have <entity>protein receptors</entity> on their <entity>plasma membranes</entity>' <entity>extracellular surfaces</entity>. When a <entity>molecule</entity> within the <entity>matrix</entity> binds to the <entity>receptor</entity>, it <entity>changes</entity> the <entity>receptor</entity>'s <entity>molecular structure</entity>. The <entity>receptor</entity>, in turn, <entity>changes</entity> the <entity>microfilaments</entity>' conformation <entity>positioned</entity> just inside the <entity>plasma membrane</entity>. These conformational <entity>changes</entity> induce <entity>chemical signals</entity> inside the <entity>cell</entity> that reach the <entity>nucleus</entity> and turn “on” or “<entity>off</entity>” the transcription of specific <entity>DNA sections</entity>, which affects the <event>associated</event> <entity>protein</entity> production, thus <entity>changing</entity> the <entity>activities</entity> within the <entity>cell</entity>.

<event>Blood clotting</event> provides an example of the <entity>extracellular matrix</entity>'s role in <event>cell communication</event>. When the <entity>cells</entity> lining a <entity>blood vessel</entity> are damaged, they display a <entity>protein receptor</entity>, which we call <entity>tissue factor</entity>. When <entity>tissue factor</entity> binds with another <entity>factor</entity> in the <entity>extracellular matrix</entity>, it <event>causes</event> <entity>platelets</entity> to adhere to the damaged <entity>blood vessel</entity>'s wall, stimulates the adjacent <entity>smooth muscle cells</entity> in the <entity>blood vessel</entity> to contract (thus constricting the <entity>blood vessel</entity>), and initiates a series of steps that stimulate the <entity>platelets</entity> to produce <entity>clotting factors</entity>.

<entity>Intercellular</entity> Junctions
<entity>Cells</entity> can also communicate with each other via direct <entity>contact</entity>, or <entity>intercellular junctions</entity>. There are differences in the ways that <entity>plant</entity> and <entity>animal</entity> and <entity>fungal cells</entity> communicate. <entity>Plasmodesmata</entity> are <entity>junctions</entity> between <entity>plant cells</entity>; whereas, <entity>animal cell contacts</entity> include <entity>tight junctions</entity>, <entity>gap junctions</entity>, and <entity>desmosomes</entity>.

Plasmodesmata
In general, long stretches of the <entity>plasma membranes</entity> of neighboring <entity>plant cells</entity> cannot touch one another because the <entity>cell</entity> wall that surrounds each <entity>cell</entity> separates them (Figure 4.8). How then, can a <entity>plant</entity> transfer water and other soil <entity>nutrients</entity> from its roots, through its stems, and to its leaves? Such <entity>transport</entity> uses the <entity>vascular tissues</entity> (<entity>xylem</entity> and <entity>phloem</entity>) primarily. There also exist <event>structural modifications</event>, which we call <entity>plasmodesmata</entity> (singular = <entity>plasmodesma</entity>). Numerous <entity>channels</entity> that pass between adjacent <entity>plant cells</entity>' <entity>cell</entity> walls connect their <entity>cytoplasm</entity>, and enable <entity>transport</entity> of materials from <entity>cell</entity> to <entity>cell</entity>, and thus throughout the <entity>plant</entity> (Figure 4.28).

This illustration shows <entity>two plant cells side</entity>-by-<entity>side</entity>. A <entity>gap</entity> in the <entity>cell</entity> wall, a <entity>plasmodesma</entity>, allows fluid and <entity>small molecules</entity> to pass from the <entity>cytoplasm</entity> of one <entity>cell</entity> to the <entity>cytoplasm</entity> of the other.
Figure 4.28 A <entity>plasmodesma</entity> is a <entity>channel</entity> between <entity>two</entity> adjacent <entity>plant cells</entity>' <entity>cell</entity> walls. <entity>Plasmodesmata</entity> allow materials to pass from one <entity>plant cell</entity>'s <entity>cytoplasm</entity> to an adjacent <entity>cell</entity>'s <entity>cytoplasm</entity>.
<entity>Tight</entity> Junctions
A <entity>tight junction</entity> is a watertight seal between <entity>two</entity> adjacent <entity>animal cells</entity> (Figure 4.29). <entity>Proteins</entity> (predominantly <entity>two proteins</entity> called <entity>claudins</entity> and <entity>occludins</entity>) tightly hold the <entity>cells</entity> against each other.

This illustration shows <entity>two cell membranes</entity> joined together by a <entity>matrix</entity> of <entity>tight junctions</entity>.
Figure 4.29 <entity>Tight junctions</entity> <entity>form</entity> watertight <entity>connections</entity> between adjacent <entity>animal cells</entity>. <entity>Proteins</entity> create <entity>tight junction adherence</entity>. (<entity>credit</entity>: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
This <entity>tight adherence</entity> prevents materials from leaking between the <entity>cells</entity>; <entity>tight junctions</entity> are typically found in <entity>epithelial tissues</entity> that <event>line</event> <entity>internal organs</entity> and cavities, and comprise most of the skin. For example, the <entity>tight junctions</entity> of the <entity>epithelial cells</entity> lining your <entity>urinary bladder</entity> prevent urine from leaking out into the <entity>extracellular space</entity>.

Desmosomes
Also only in <entity>animal cells</entity> are <entity>desmosomes</entity>, which act like <entity>spot welds</entity> between adjacent <entity>epithelial cells</entity> (Figure 4.30). <entity>Cadherins</entity>, short <entity>proteins</entity> in the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> connect to <event>intermediate filaments</event> to create <entity>desmosomes</entity>. The <entity>cadherins</entity> connect <entity>two</entity> adjacent <entity>cells</entity> and maintain the <entity>cells</entity> in a sheet-like formation in <entity>organs</entity> and <entity>tissues</entity> that stretch, like the skin, <entity>heart</entity>, and <entity>muscles</entity>.

This illustration shows <entity>two cells</entity> <entity>fused</entity> together by a <entity>desmosome</entity>. <entity>Cadherins</entity> extend from each <entity>cell</entity> and join the <entity>two cells</entity> together. <event>Intermediate filaments</event> connect to <entity>cadherins</entity> on the inside of the <entity>cell</entity>.
Figure 4.30 A <entity>desmosome</entity> <entity>forms</entity> a very strong <entity>spot weld</entity> between <entity>cells</entity>. Linking <entity>cadherins</entity> and <event>intermediate filaments</event> create it. (<entity>credit</entity>: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
<entity>Gap</entity> Junctions
<entity>Gap junctions</entity> in <entity>animal cells</entity> are like <entity>plasmodesmata</entity> in <entity>plant cells</entity> in that they are <entity>channels</entity> between adjacent <entity>cells</entity> that allow for <entity>transporting</entity> <entity>ions</entity>, <entity>nutrients</entity>, and other substances that enable <entity>cells</entity> to communicate (Figure 4.31). Structurally, however, <entity>gap junctions</entity> and <entity>plasmodesmata</entity> differ.

This illustration shows <entity>two cells</entity> joined together with <entity>protein pores</entity> called <entity>gap junctions</entity> that allow water and <entity>small molecules</entity> to pass through.
Figure 4.31 A <entity>gap junction</entity> is a <entity>protein</entity>-<event>lined</event> <entity>pore</entity> that allows water and <entity>small molecules</entity> to pass between adjacent <entity>animal cells</entity>. (<entity>credit</entity>: <event>modification</event> of <entity>work</entity> by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)
<entity>Gap junctions</entity> develop when a set of six <entity>proteins</entity> (<entity>connexins</entity>) in the <entity>plasma membrane</entity> arrange themselves in an elongated <entity>donut</entity>-like configuration - a <entity>connexon</entity>. When the <entity>connexon</entity>'s <entity>pores</entity> (“<entity>doughnut holes</entity>”) in adjacent <entity>animal cells</entity> align, a <entity>channel</entity> between the <entity>two cells forms</entity>. <entity>Gap junctions</entity> are particularly important in <entity>cardiac muscle</entity>. The <entity>electrical signal</entity> for the <entity>muscle</entity> to contract passes efficiently through <entity>gap junctions</entity>, allowing the <entity>heart muscle cells</entity> to contract in tandem.
